Dave Laemmle,Trying to track extra bandwidth utilization for Seattle Times,7/19/10,LIC-001665,7/19/10 15:56,0,1,The Seattle Times,1047,,"With the ExtraHop system you can find which clients were most actively uploading and downloading with a particular device by looking at the Layer 3 stats for that device.

I checked the ISP device (192.251.219.100) you pointed out. In general the download throughput from June 1 through June 30 was over 20 mb/s, which was higher than the month before and after.  The upload rate seemd to stay pretty consistent throughout the May to July time frame. After digging deeper into specific days it looked like there was a higher amount of traffic coming from ""forums.seattletimes.nwsource.com"" during this month than normal. 
<Device - L2 - Image>

I then highlighted one of the specific spikes to extract a 24 hour period during this increased download. (June 9 - June 10). I  went to the L3 section for this device and ordered the stat table below the graphs by ""Bytes-In"". This ISP device downloaded far more data (117 GB) from forums.seattletimes.nwsource.com (aka archives) (192.251.222.150) than any other ip address. This forums server is not directly monitored by the ExtraHop and we see it as a host coming through the Firewall1 - Inet device.
<image - L3 protocol bytes in sort > 
I then ordered the list by ""Bytes-Out"". The device that was most uploaded to from the ISP device during that 24 hour period was collective.seatimes.com (192.251.219.11).
<image - L3 protocol bytes out sort > 
I checked a few other 24 hour dates in June and found that the ""Bytes-In"" rate to forums.seattletimes.nwsource.com was generally over 70 GB during this month. I then looked at 24 hour periods in May and July and found that in general download amounts for forums was closer to 45 GB. 
<image - L3-other 24 hour period1>
<image - L3-other 24 hour period2>


Because forums is not a device directly monitored by the ExtraHop we can not view which device were the top downloaders from the forums site.

Let me know if this helps and if you have any further questions or clarifications. We also have recently added several training programs to our services.  We can deliver it over the web in one 4 hour session or 2 - 2hour sessions.  Let me know if you are interested and I can get you a quote.

Support Case Queue,[Fwd: Re: DB2 Custom Ports Diagnostic Pack for Kohls],9/7/10,,9/7/10 16:02,0,1,Kohl's Corporation,20100907-01171,,"When the diagnostic pack was applied, it restarted the capture process, which means the ExtraHop begin capturing and parsing transaction flows midstream. We do not classify the traffic unless we see the beginning of a transaction, so transactions we see midstream will be unclassified.

As clients reconnect to servers and recreate transactions, the ExtraHop will begin to classify more, and the amount of traffic assigned to ports will diminish.

In the image you sent, you can see that before the diagnostic pack was applied TNS (Oracle) traffic was well classified, it dropped to nothing after the diagnostic pack, and is now growing. Meanwhile ports 1573 and 1571 had the inverse action.

TCP 33050 looks like it grew a bit after the restart and should begin to be more classified as uninterrupted monitoring continues. Long lived DB transactions may stick around as unclassified ports for a while. If there are a large number of drops in the traffic being spanned to us, we may continue to miss some DB transactions starts, so  there may be some unclassified traffic due to this.

Let me know if this makes sense,"

Dave Laemmle,Migration ExtraHop customizations to a new system,9/13/10,,9/13/10 13:39,0,1,McAfee LLC,20100913-01191,,"I have been doing some more research on how to use our download and upload customizations feature to transfer customizations to another system.

Customizations refer to modifications made Alerts, Devices, Networks, Groups, etc.  Unfortunately, customizations do not include administration modifications, such as users, alert notifications , time settings, etc. I have created customer enhancement request 1040 to address this.

If you are replacing one system with another,  then transferring customizations can be useful, since the devices discovered by the new system will match the old. Things that will not be transfered include capture related modifications and some alert assignments.

Here are the steps to do this.
On System 1 :
1. Log into the Admin UI.

2. Choose the ""Datastore"" option in the System Settings section.


3. On the Datastore screen choose ""Upload/Download Customizations""


4. Download the customizations to your local machine.




On System 2 :
1. Log into the Admin UI

2. Choose the Datastore option the System Settings section.
3. On the Datastore screen choose ""Upload/Download Customizations""
4. Upload the customizations file you saved earlier.




Please note that if devices have not been discovered yet, some  customizations may not be assigned. You can reload customizations again later after more devices have been discovered to assign those customizations, however any new customizations will be lost."
Dave Laemmle,Alert to signal device is over capacity,9/13/10,,9/13/10 13:45,0,1,McAfee LLC,20100913-01192,,"The new 10Gig system has much more memory and processing power than the 1Gig unit it is replacing and we have also added a number of stability enhancements that improve the ExtraHop's handling of an oversubscribed SPAN. These enhancements keep the ExtraHop operating and responding, as well as collecting and parsing traffic.

However, exceeding specifications for throughput and/or monitored number of devices may cause the ExtraHop to perform less than ideally. For EH5000, we recommend that you monitor no more than 10Gbps and ~1000 MAC addresses. 

An alert based on recorded traffic metrics (e.g. incoming traffic == 0) may not be the best way to detect that the device is being oversubscribed, because this event could be due to an expected occurrence, such as span port being temporarily shut down. Instead, we have an SNMP service that can be enabled on the ExtraHop system, which allows a customer to remotely monitor the system health of the ExtraHop hardware via SNMP. The MIB returned is a generic SNMP MIB with details about the CPUs and memory as well as Two ExtraHop specific counters : packets processed and bytes processed.  A remote tool can compare these values over time to determine if the ExtraHop is processing network traffic or not. Many customers have found this a useful way to monitor the ExtraHop system.

I am attaching a document on Alerting and the updated ExtraHop MIB. If you have further questions about the SNMP service, let me know.

Dave Laemmle,Saving Customizations,9/13/10,,9/13/10 15:09,0,1,Adobe,20100913-01193,,"Sent email how how to save customizations .
Andika,

Yes there is.

Before resetting the datastore, you can save customizations.
Then after the datastore reset, you can restore those customizations.

You will want to wait a little bit before restoring the customizations so that the devices will be deiscovered first.  You can re-restore your customizations again if some devices customizations are not present.


I am attaching a guide that covers resetting the datastore and customization saving.

And you can see it in the device's TCP connection graph as well. The dips in outgoing and closed connections are related to data not being sent to the ExtraHop system. 

Here is a graph of the ATT Portal ATT.net's desync rate over a 30 minute window.  When the spikes on this graph occur,  the ExtraHop is not receiving packets from the span. These desync spikes can be can be correlated to the dips on the TCP connection graph."

Note: Often customers confuse the need to filter something out at our appliance, versus the need to filter something out at the switch. In State Street's use case below, turns out, the backup traffic is so voluminous that it causes traffic within a single VLAN to exceed 1Gbps (and they only have 1Gbps) span ports. The real solution for them is to either get 10G span ports or to utilize VACL capture to filter out the backup traffic at the switch before it overruns the span port. 

Update: State Street will be upgrading its switches to 10G capable at the end of 2010, so this will become a non-issue, once 10G span ports are available.

Update 03/13/2011: We introduced the ability to filter out traffic at the capture on the destination port. To filter out backup traffic, the customer would have to specify their NetBackup port number TCP:13724."

Subject: Re: Question about reading DNS errors report
    Andika,
    I wanted to give you an answer on the report PDF you sent in.
    The way to read that report is that there were X number of queries that resulted in X number of errors.
    In the report you sent (2 entries from the report are in the table below), the jboss-da1-3 device sent 32 DNS lookups for host-sjc0-52.corp.adobe.com.corp.adobe.com and all 32 failed. The jboss device also performed 62 DNS queries for host-sjc0-52.corp.adobe.com , and all were successful.
    Host                                             Host Queries     Query Errors
    host-sjc0-52.corp.adobe.com.corp.adobe.com         32               32
    host-sjc0-52.corp.adobe.com                        62

    The /etc/hosts file gets read before any DNS query is done, so putting the FQDN into the /etc/hosts will not send DNS requests over the wire at all.
    Using nslookup directly connects to the DNS servers and ignores the normal search order or client resolver settings, so it doesn't really reflect how an application on the system is resolving the name. ""ping"" or ""telnet"" might be better tools for investigating this DNS issue. Ping will use the resolv.conf 's search order to determine the address.
    Could there be something incorrect in the order of the name resolution setup? Possibly something that is forcing the name to be checked against the domain list in the search prior to trying the name by itself? An Apache or jboss setting maybe?  What does the local resolv.conf show?  If you remove the FQDN entry from /etc/hosts and try a ping, what does the ExtraHop show?

    Example of nslookup vs ping :
    My resolv.conf shows
        search local.corp.company.com corp.company.com company.com
        nameserver 10.10.1.254

    dave@mercury:~$ nslookup www
    Server:        10.10.1.1
    Address:    10.10.1.1#53

    Non-authoritative answer:
    Name:    www.company.com
    Address: 173.255.192.141

    dave@:~$ ping www
    PING www.company.com (173.255.192.141) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from li202-141.members.linode.com (173.255.192.141): icmp_seq=1 ttl=47 time=424 ms

    64 bytes from li202-141.members.linode.com (173.255.192.141): icmp_seq=4 ttl=47 time=53.8 ms

    With nslookup I get the following information on the ExtraHop
    Host                                             Host Queries     Query Errors
    www.company.com                                    1               

    With Ping the extrahop shows
    Host                                             Host Queries     Query Errors
    www.local.corp.company.com                         1                1
    www.corp.company.com                               1                1
    www.company.com                                    1               

    Let me know if this helps,

We recently noticed this issue as well. It is related to the version of the NIC's driver in use by version 2.0. As you can see, this is fixed in version 3.0. Because the 3.0 release is imminent, we are holding off on applying the driver change to 2.0. Let me know if this is an issue for you.

Tony -- we took a look and here are some preliminary thoughts.

I see the following:
- Retransmissions and retransmission timeouts from 172.27.2.71 to 138.113.3.53
- Instances of bad congestion control from 172.27.2.71 to 138.113.3.53, which indicates that the current device is sending too much data resulting in network congestion and dropped packets.
- RTT is high and variable (mean >600ms with standard deviation of 2s)

In general, this looks like a problem sending data from 172.27.2.71 to 138.113.3.53. It could be a problem with either:
- Host issue(s):
* Duplex mismatches could be the cause for data loss
* TCP settings on the Sun system causing it to ignore congestion signaling and send too much data regardless (this would compound the issue in the case of data loss)
- Downstream router/link
* Check link quality between the router and the remote site
* Router congestion 

Recommendations for next steps:
- Check for a duplex mismatch between the Sun system and the router
- Check link quality to partner (looks like Pegasus?)
- Are these systems (Sun system & router) visible to the ExtraHop appliance we have installed on-site? If so, we could take a look at a wider set of data, in order to rule out issues like a downstream router
- Solaris administrators might want to check output of netstat, sysctl, and ndd on the Sun system to help rule out TCP configuration issues

Hope this helps -- I believe that Kurt (support) and Zach (SE) are already setting up a live review session as a follow-up.

Thanks!

t is possible to do what you are trying to accomplish.  There are several ways to do this, depending on what you are after.

At the capture level, you can use the ""capture -> http -> req"" for requests and ""capture -> http -> rsp"" for responses.  These metrics are an aggregate of all http traffic seen in the ExtraHop capture.

You can use the same metrics at the device level (req and rsp)  
device -> http -> client (or server) -> req (or rsp)

These metrics specifically look at the network transit time for HTTP.  If you are interested in the processing time on the HTTP servers, 3.0 also now has a system level alert to watch HTTP server processing time called ""Slow Web Response Time"""

Dave Laemmle,Is it normal for the Heap to has this pattern?,3/16/11,,3/16/11 9:23,0,1,State Street - Irvine,20110316-01679,,"Thank you for the diagnostic pack and the PDF. I analyzed them and confirmed what I mentioned below. In the graph you sent it shows the heap going to zero four times during the last month.  The first one was due to the ExtraHop firmware update we did on Feb 24. The other 3 were due to the capture restarting itself in order to reallocate resources that were locked by stale flows. When do you think you will move the P2 system to a 10 gig environment? That would reduce the span drops that cause stale flows to exist.

The rest of the diagnostic pack looked very good and did not show any potential issues. Is everything else with the data on that ExtraHop system fine? We will continue to analyze the diagnostic pack to see how we might be able to better reallocate resources and reduce the need to restart the capture.

Sincerely,

Dave
---------------------------

Song,

I wouldn't say that is normal, but it isn't completely unexpected. In environments where the span port is overloaded and there are lots of drops, we will grow memory quite a bit and do our best to clean out stale bits, but over time we may have to restart the capture to completely reallocate resources.

You are looking at a month of data, and it appears that these occur about weekly, so that might mean we have another issue at hand as well, or a regular backup that pushes the memory usage over the limit.

Can you run the built in diagnostic pack and upload it to your ftp site for me so I can do some deeper analysis. Also if you can send me a screen shot of the top of this L2 page and an image for just the last week, that would be great.

Spoke to Robert on the phone a couple of times. A few issues:
1. Clarified response time vs. processing time.

The Heap graph shows how much memory the ExtraHop capture process is currently using to track the flows and metrics. The capture does not regularly return this memory to the pool, but reuses it instead. 
This memory will grow when new allocations can not be created from the current pool. When some internal thresholds are passed, older, long lived stale flows will be scrubbed and the heap will be reduced.  On the EH5000, the heap can grow as high as 9 gig before more aggressive memory clean up action is begun.

One more possibility for #1 below.  If you are trying to match up in and out, they may not line up exactly.  It could be that the device is actually a router for multiple VMS, which means the counts will be spread over all the ips that device A talks to through device B. 

Let me try to answer the questions below.

Hi Ron,
I've looking at this data this afternoon and have a few comments:

- For your first concern, ""the NLB VIP doesn’t show up in Extrahop associated with the NLB mac address,"" I would like to see what the ARP traffic on the network looks like. You might want to run Netmon, filtering by ARP responses, to see what IP/MAC associations are being made. That's where ExtraHop picks up these associations.

- For the issue of ""2 other device names show up associated with this IP address and with similar mac addresses to each other,"" if you just mean the first three octets, 00:25:B3, that is just an indication that they are made by the same manufacturer - HP. Let me know if you meant something else.

- The MAC address 02:BF:0A:FB:1E:25 should be the cluster MAC. (In the case of NLB, the cluster MAC will have BF as its second octet.) It would make sense that its TCP metrics would have all of the ""Accepted"" connections. I agree that it's odd that 10.251.31.40 is associated with the cluster MAC in the UI, unless this was is configured as the cluster VIP for whichever node is sending ARP responses. (ExtraHop uses the ARPs that it sees on the network to associate IP addresses and MAC addresses.) In any case, it would be valuable to again run Netmon, filtering for APRs, to see if you can figure out which host is sending that ARP response, associating the cluster MAC with a DIP.

- I also find it odd that 10.251.31.39 is showing relatively few connections. Could this be a problem with the load balancing setup?


From your previous e-mail around seeing inflated resends because the packets are being counted twice, the reasoning is that ExtraHop needs to be throw away the MAC and TTL (and other fields that change while a packet is in route) in order to track the same packet across multiple networks and at different stages in transit. If it used fields that change, such as the MAC address and TTL, it wouldn't be able to keep track of the same packet, and it would have incorrect metrics for number of connections, packets sent, etc. Does that make sense?
Also, I checked with some of the engineers and found that ExtraHop will count the same packets seen in multiple locations as a retransmit, but not additional zero windows.

Glad to hear Pablo was helpful, by the way! Hopefully he had some useful information or at least could point you to resources that could help with your SQL clustering issue.

Dave Laemmle,extrahop mac<-> IP mismatch,5/17/11,,5/17/11 17:33,0,1,thePlatform,20110518-01844,,"Andy, 

This is correct behavior when discovering devices by IP. The 10.1.8.0/24 network is a remote L3 network and is not physically on the network being spanned to the ExtraHop. Each IP address on that network will be treated as a single device, however the ExtraHop does not see the device's actual MAC address and assigns the MAC of the router/load balancer that handles the device's traffic. 

If you go to the Devices page and search by 4C:7C:00, you will see that there are 47 different devices that have this MAC address. All these devices are part of the remote networks configured for your system. Many of them have the default ""[Vendor]  [MAC Low Order Bits Hex value]""  name convention. This name is assigned when the ExtraHop has not seen a device respond to a DNS request. The devices that do have unique names have responded to DNS queries over the network being spanned to the ExtraHop. 

When you look at the list you will see one device that has no IP address; this is the actual Router device, It should also have a router icon next to it.  See 
extrahop/#All Devices?details=true&deviceOid=8&view=device

There is a more recent release available that displays these L3 discovered devices in a hierarchal layout, making the relationship a little easier to recognize. It will also assign default names when a device is discovered using the IP address rather than using the MAC address, which will lessen confusion when looking at the Device specific pages. 

I Hope this makes thins more clear. Let me know if you have any further questions.

Hi Kemp,
Yes, both 10 gig interfaces are active and either or both can be used at once. However, 10 gig is the maximum throughput for the entire NIC (not 20 gig), so the individual 10 gig ports can transfer a total of 10 gig (such as 5 gig + 5 gig or 2 gig + 8 gig, etc.).

Jason Epstein,Missing Data After Applying License,5/18/11,,5/18/11 18:06,0,1,Widevine Technologies,20110519-01852,,"I called Blake and got things sorted out. The system is fine. He upgraded the firmware on 5/15, but hadn't yet applied the new license. Afterwords, he looked at the system and saw data. However, the capture would have been stopped and he would have been looking at old data without realizing it wasn't current.
When he installed the new license, the capture began collecting data again, but the default 30-minute window had no data, so it looked like his data was scrubbed. On the phone, I had him increase the time window   (I asked him to do 7 days, but he had already selected 30 days, which is fine), and he saw his old data again. There was a straight line on whichever graph he was looking at between 5/15 and today, which makes sense since no new data was being collected.
He said all looked good, except he didn't see any data from before 4/27, even though he had a 30-day window selected. He had seen pre-4/27 data in the past. I'm not sure why this is, but the issue is much more minor than complete data disappearance."

The two ""types"" showing up on the Gigamon, ""T"" and ""N"" (x1 and x2, respectively), are for control and network (sounds analogous to our ""admin"" and ""data"" ports).

The first 10G port (black) is connected to the Gigamon. The second 10G port (green) is connected to a router. Kemp does not have physical access to the EH (it's in Tukwilla), but he can contact folks who do.

I suggested he try a few things to narrow this down:
- Check the cables and SFP connectors to make sure everything is seated correctly.
- Switch the SFP cables to see if the colors change.
- Switch the SFP connectors to see if the colors change.

He said he'll have the team in the data center do this and he'll get back to us. He wants to get this taken care of in the next couple of days because, after Friday, he'll be out for a month."

Let me start with the easy one: 
Retransmissions are counted when we see the exact same packet twice.  It is simply a count of those events, not necessarily a measure of performance.

RTO's
Here is an entry from our online KB that describes RTO's and retransmissions: 
----------------
RTO is short for ""retransmission timeout"". An RTO event is a long (greater than 1 second) delay in the TCP connection data flow due to network congestion. 

Retransmissions are often considered as the main indicator of network congestion, however, a certain amount of retransmissions is normal. For example, during connection setup, the TCP algorithm figures out the bandwidth of a connection by exponentially increasing the rate at which data is sent until retransmissions occur. So, on a device that frequently sets up and tears down connections, retransmissions are going to occur. 

RTOs, however, are an indication of congestion impacting normal data flow. The ExtraHop system simulates the TCP state machine on both sides of the connection and times delays due to retransmissions. When such delays exceed 1 second, the ExtraHop system records a ""retransmission timeout"" or RTO event.

If you see a high degree of RTOs on a certain device, follow these steps to troubleshoot:
- Note whether these RTOs are inbound or outbound -- this may indicate whether the data affected by congestion is sent to or from the device
- Click on the counter next to the RTO label to see which IP addresses have trouble talking to the device you are looking at
- Note whether the peer IP addresses are on the same LAN or a going through a hop:
  * If they are on the same LAN -- check TCP settings: enabling selective acknowledgments and fast recovery might reduce RTOs.
  * If it is the latter, that router may be overloaded -- check related switch ports for drops and router health settings for indications of overload
-----------------

I also found an entry that indicates RTO's may be caused by duplex mismatches.  The symptom is an evenly spread distribution of RTO to all peers, which is similar to what you are seeing."

It depends on which Retrans number is higher.  Is it higher on the windows side or on the Extrahop side.  If it is on the Windows side, it is possible that the OS is sending packets that never make it to ExtraHop.  I remember we saw some desyncing during training that indicates some traffic is dropping before it gets to the appliance.  If you see more in Extrahop, it could be due to the SPAN configuration.  The SPAN could be configured in such a way that it is sending the appliance packets twice.

Bad congestion control is an indication that the advertised TCP window sizes are not being respected by the peer and the peer is continually sending too much data even though it has bee told that the size is incorrect."

Thank you for outlining your use case so clearly in email -- it's a delight to receive enhancement requests from you! :)

Incidentally, we are shoring up flexibility of our alerting configuration in our 3.5 release (recently named ""Cyclops"") and the use case you mentioned -- allowing threshold-based alerts to be evaluated over custom intervals -- is going to be addressed. In that release, we are also introducing basic multivariate alerting, allowing user to exclude time periods (e.g. during maintenance), additional choices of units, and so on. 

I would love to get your feedback on the new enhancements! Cyclops is in QA right now and I'll make sure to keep you posted on the timing of the release.

Thank you,

Jason Epstein,Re: ExtraHop POC Shipping Address,8/3/11,,8/3/11 14:15,0,1,Mixpo,20110803-02011,,"Hi Matt,
The Admin port is the one that you'll need to connect to your network and use to access the ExtraHop. Do you use DHCP or static IP addresses? (DHCP is generally easier, but we can guide you through static too.) Once the machine has an IP address, you'll be able to scroll through the menu in the small LED display on the front of the physical appliance to get its IP address.

Yes, you should be able to ping the appliance, using its IP address.

The data port will be used to collect data. That should be connected to your switch's SPAN port (or TAP or aggregator, if you use that).

Does this help?

Jason

There is no way to alert on a behavior across a group, e.g. ""tell me when # of requests or throughput across devices in a group is abnormally high"".

In the short term, it will be possible to address this with triggers by recording a custom capture-level metric that tracks a metric available in the trigger across a group of devices, and then alert off this metric. This will only be available for certain stats, e.g. HTTP requests, but not for other stats, such as TCP metrics and total bytes/packet for a device.

However, a method for doing this that does not require writing a trigger would be desirable.

Hi Tavi,
It looks like you've opened a case and need help resetting your system's password.
As you probably already know, the default setup password is the serial number (with the letters in all caps). If the password has been changed, you'll need to reset it with the ExtraHop Rescue CD. The simplest way to do this, unfortunately, also clears your running config, which contains some of your customizations. However, device names, device groups, and your datastore will not be affected.

To do this, do the following steps:
- Reboot the system
- While it is booting, press F11 as soon as it displays the F-commands in the upper right-hand corner of the boot screen. (F11 takes you to the BIOS Boot Manager.)
- In the boot options menu that follows, select the SATA Optical Drive to boot from the CD.
- Once in the ExtraHop Rescue CD options menu, select Reset System Configuration.
This will reset your passwords to their default.

ExtraHop had not come up since that time.  Customer rebooted the system several times to try to fix situation, to no avail.  Resetting datastore was useless.  Exportal would not start.  With Dave L's help, we got support level access to the system, to find that /var/extrahop was corrupt and portal.db was no longer readable.  They also had core files enabled, taking up disk space.

After Dave L restored portal.db and cleared some disk space, the system recovered.  A quite data review with Long showed that ExtraHop was already seeing over 1000 devices.  We mentioned this, and Long said that it was actually monitoring 7000 devices.  We soon saw more than 10000 devices.  Capture was constantly and continuously crashing.  I explained the need to decrease dramatically the number of devices going to ExtraHop."

Hi Kevin,
Currently, the user accounts are not saved in the config and will not be restored. However, I found out from our senior product manager that an enhancement request had been filed and is currently being tracked around this.
That said, if you use central authentication, such as LDAP/Active Directory or RADIUS, they do get restored since the account information is not stored locally.

Jason Epstein,Problems in getting LDAP Auth to work,9/22/11,,9/22/11 14:11,0,1,Conestoga College,20110922-02102,,"E-mail to Kevin:

Hi Kevin,
Is this an AD server (as opposed to LDAP)? If so, you'll need to use ""sAMAccountName"" as your Login Attribute (not the default ""uid""). If that doesn't fix it, we'll need to do a WebEx session so we can dig into what's going on.
In the meantime, I've attached our LDAP document that has additional information on configuring LDAP authentication in ExtraHop.
 
Jason

(Attached LDAP auth config document)

----------------------

Response from Kevin:

Ok, I managed to get it to work, but not sure exactly why.  I changed a couple of things in the Remote Authentication settings as follows:
 
-          Changed the hostname from the DNS name to the IP address
-          Changed the Login Attribute from SAMAccountName to sAMAccountName (changed the S to lowercase s)
-          Changed the Bind DN from ldap_browse@conestogac.on.ca to “CN=ldap_browse,CN=Managed Service Accounts,DC=conestogac,DC=on,DC=ca”
 
Since I always like to know why things start to work, I went back and changed each item back to what I had, and lo and behold, it still works.  Go figure!
 
Thanks for providing the LDAP guide, as I will use it to restrict users in our AD to only certain users in specific OU’s.
 
Regards,
Kevin"

===============

E-mail from Matthew Beck on 10/14:

Well now that’s extremely interesting!  And perfectly logical too.  I wondered why the device view page had L2/L3 options on that pull-down menu and now I see why.  I also never noticed the tree control stuff you pointed out so thanks for that.  A similar situation would occur with MS SQL clusters wouldn’t it?  (or any NIC that hosts multiple IP addresses)  The virtual IP address would be detected as a layer 3 device but since it shares a MAC address with the currently active host there would be some duplication.  And if the MS SQL cluster failed over to the other host the parent MAC address would change accordingly.  (That assumes MS SQL does gratuitous ARPs in a failover and doesn’t use a virtual MAC – I’d have to check that)

All right, I get it now and I now know my span config is providing exactly the data it should.  The Extrahop is also handling this data just as it should so please go ahead and close this ticket (if there is one) and thanks again for the help!

Enjoy your weekend,
                Matt"

When the devices started showing up, some L3 devices had the same MAC address (which John recognized as that of the router). He said the devices were behind the router. This seemed odd to me and I asked if the routers could be answering ARPs for the devices behind it. He thought that could be the case, but wasn't sure. In any case, he said he was happy with the data he was now seeing.

He may also want to enable Remote Networks, but I didn't want to suggest that without knowing more about his networks. Also, it didn't seem like a hi-pri need right now."

I got feedback from our engineers. They do not recommend this.

First, the devices from the capture will not show up unless you set the time interval to the period during which the capture was collected. Second, the timestamps may have inconsistencies since they come from the packet time for the offline capture.

In general, it will probably make the view more confusing than anything. Your best bet is to view the ExtraHop with the offline data and the ECM system separately.

Jason"

When he called, he was kind of unsure how to get support. ""Hi. I just dialed the number listed for support. What do I need to do to get help with this?"" (paraphrased) I asked his name and company (REI) and then led him through obtaining the serial number (in the Admin UI, under licensing). And then asked how I could help. I don't think he realized that he was already talking to support. He seemed surprised how easy it was to get help. He probably expected to have to give me a bunch of information and then have his call transferred to some tier 1 support desk overseas, where he'd be instructed to reboot his system to see if the problem went away. (He seemed pleased that the first person to pick up the phone was a real higher-level support person who could help him right on the spot.)

He just deployed the system two weeks ago. Since then, he hasn't seen many alerts until today. He had changed the aggregation period from 30 seconds to 15 minutes to cut down on the number of alerts, but it didn't really help. He asked if that was a reasonable thing to do. I said it would smooth out microbursts, which might be desirable.

We launched a WebEx and he showed me the dozens of alerts in his inbox. (Realistically, I already believed him, but if he wants still wants to prove it to me, that's fine.) We then looked at the alerts, where I explained what the metrics meant, including what the sensitivity value of 6 meant (number of standard deviations from the mean), and how ""normal"" was calculated (trend over the past four weeks).

We then went to the GUI and looked at Network/Alert History. There, we saw the ARP Storm alert firing. We went to L2 metrics and compared the number of ARPs for a 16-hour period today, and then a similar period a week ago, and then again for the week before that. We did the same for a one-hour period in the early morning. The number of ARPs a week ago were similar to the number today. The number from two weeks ago were much lower. There was no data from before that. (At first I thought that the period of no data would mean that 0's would be factored into the mean, but later learned that they are not.)

We then went to the Alert History section and found the High RTT alerts for some of the devices. We clicked on one of the alert-causing devices and looked at the RTT graph on the TCP page. I had him expand the time interval to the past four weeks so we could see the trend. We saw that the average level two weeks ago was much lower than the average for today, and so the same issue (low data from two weeks ago weighing down the average) was likely causing the alert flood.

To solve this, we went to the alerts section, where I was planning to guide him through turning off notifications for the alerts. He would then wait two weeks, which should hopefully be enough time for the trends to have four weeks of stable historical data, and then turn them back on. However, I had forgotten about exclusion intervals, When I saw them, I decided that a one-time two week exclusion interval was an even better solution, since the alerts would then reactivate automatically in two weeks without him having to remember to turn them back on.
We did that and, at least for a 10-minute period, no new alerts fired. He'll follow up if he has any more problems.

He seemed really appreciative of the fact that reaching ExtraHop Support (and actually getting real help on the spot) was so easy. I plan to follow up with him after two weeks has passed and the alerts are active again, to make sure the better trend data really has caused better alerting (fewer false positives).

Since Established Max is a high water mark for the time interval, if that dropped to 0, I think that would be an effective alert.  Unfortunately, it does not appear that we allow alerts on Established Max.  I cc'd Tanya, Dave L and James since I'm not sure if this is a bug or as designed.

Have you time trended the Accepted, Connected, and Established counts?  I am wondering if you could set up a standard deviation alert based on that activity.  So if there is a regular pattern (e.g. 5-10 connections are always made during a 1 min interval), you could use a < normal alert on that count.

Hope this helps."

Bernie pointed to high retransmissions and desyncs and suggested these were caused by a behavior in Windows, in which is closes connections if too many unACKed connections come in (a DoS attack).
We saw SYNs total approximately double the number of accepted connections. I pointed out that this would not be high enough to be considered a SYN flood.
We saw some RTOs, Zero Wnds, and dropped segments and lots of Snd Wnd Rcv Throttles both outbound and inbound on the core-08, one of the front-end web servers. However, nothing jumped out at us as being an obvious smoking gun.

We looked at the HTTP server metrics on the Middle Tier (which the Core tier talked to over HTTP), and the ReqXfer, RspXfer, and Process times looked fine. We also looked at the DB server metrics (which the Core tier talked to for session information and, again, the ReqXfer, RspXfer, and Process times looked fine.

Bernie then showed me a spreadsheet that contained results of running Perfmon on the Core tier (front-end) servers. We saw memory and disk write utilization looking fine, but the CPUs were pegged. They climbed from 78% to 100% and sat there until they were restarted. This was likely the issue. After looking at a bunch of other things, I concluded the following:
- The Core servers' communication to the back end (Middle tier and DB session servers) looked good at the app layer and OK at the TCP layer (maybe not great, but good enough that it wasn't likely the problem).
- The Core servers were maxed out on CPU. Either they don't have enough capacity for a spike like the one brought on by the Facebook IPO or the application should be modified to be more performant, at least CPU-wise.
- Due to a reasonable number of SYNs, this did not appear to be a SYN attack against the Core servers.
- The Core servers (running Windows) was not likely actively shutting down connections to rescue itself from a DoS attack. Besides the above point that shows that a DoS attack was unlikely, the CPU was so heavily utilized that might not have even been able to run such a process effectively. Some of the TCP behavior symptoms, such as dropped segments and outbound RTOs were likely caused by the server not having enough CPU available to handle incoming ACKs and, therefore, not receiving them at the TCP layer. Also, such an activity, if working correctly, should not max out the CPU."

For the first issue, the ExtraHop Customer Forum (forum.extrahop.com) would be the best place to get this answered. It is monitored by several active users who are very trigger-savvy.

- Editing and saving LDAP settings blanks out the bind_pw (I just opened this as Trac ticket #2945 - https://titanium.sea.i.extrahop.com/trac/extrahop/ticket/2945).
This was likely the original cause of this issue. It took us a few tries to figure out that this is what was happening. Fortunately, we could look at the plain running config to see that the bind_pw was being changed from the correct password to """".
- Resetting the password on the AD server side requires several minutes for the settings to propagate to all DCs. (This is not ExtraHop related, but was an issue we had to work through on the call.) This meant that, even after correctly configuring the AD settings (particularly the bind_pw), he was still not able to log into the ExtraHop successfully, since he also just had his user password reset.
Once we waited a few minutes, it worked."

This looks like an issue with no metrics ever being written in 3.5 before the 3.7 upgrade so there was a failure with migration. I think once data is written, it is not an issue. 
This was addresses in r15114, which is why you see pop-ups rather than exceptions behind the scene. 

From the bug commit :
Display an error message when an alert has an invalid param or param2
field, rather than throwing an exception.

This should occur only when the capture has not been run before upgrading
to 3.7, and can be fixed by restarting exportal once the capture has been
run.

Hi Andika,
First, you will not need a new license. Your same product key will allow the system to continue to run on 3.7.
Second, your customizations will be migrated over to the new version, and will be preserved. That said, it is still a good idea to back up your customizations and running config before upgrading.

Jason Epstein,System not booting,8/17/12,,8/16/12 11:46,0,1,Motricity,20120816-02961,,"Background:

Motricity was having trouble connecting to the ExtraHop (which they later realized was a problem with the port on their patch panel), and rebooted it. It wouldn't boot up completely, so they power-cycled it several times. That still didn't fix the issue, so they called us.

Interaction with Support:

We realized quickly that the USB drive either had corrupt files on it or went bad (most likely the former), but they weren't able to get IDRAC set up and didn't have phone reception from the data center to allow us to walk through the needed steps with them over the phone. One of us would have to go over there. Fortunately, they are pretty close by (near the Space Needle).

Before heading over, Dave L. went through the steps with me to save their customizations off of their old USB (assuming it was still readable) and David H. spent time in the lab testing out the ""install-and-switch"" scenario (install EH on one system, and then move the USB to second system while preserving the second system's existing data). This worked, so we installed EH on a system and I took out the USB (along with a couple of backup USBs and a couple of Rescue CDs) and off I went.

In Motricity's data center, we went through the steps to save off their existing config and replace the USB. However, when I tried to rebooted, it froze in the CTRL-E prompt of the boot cycle. I stared at it for a couple of minutes, hoping it would soon continue, but it didn't. If someone were standing very close to me, he/she might have noticed me beginning to sweat a little.
Then it dawned on me. This was the same problem I ran into in the lab before I left the office. When you replace a USB drive, the system automatically moves the USB to be second in the boot order, after the hard drive (it's supposed to be first). A quick reboot and BIOS change, and we were golden.

With the system now booted and running, the next question was whether we were successful in preserving their historical data. I warned them that we might not be. I copied the customizations back from the hard drive to the USB, we configured the IP address, and then we headed over to a workstation to look at the GUI. After re-registering the license key, presto! The old data appeared. I had them look at the past 30 days just to make sure and, sure enough, it was there.

Other Notes:

- They are going to work on getting their IDRAC set up, so that they can troubleshoot remotely, if needed, in the future.
- They have two ExtraHops sitting on the shelf, not being used. These came from overseas data centers (Delhi and Indonesia?) that have since been closed down. Since they feel they already have full coverage with the ExtraHop in deployment, they are not planning to deploy either of the two shelf appliances. (However, Cal had the great suggestion of proposing they use one of the other systems to beta test high-availability functionality, once available. We briefly talked to PM about that and will pursue that separately.)
- They seemed pretty impressed that we sent someone over there to fix their system. When a system breaks, a great customer experience can buys us a lot of forgiveness. :-)"

There were several issues with the TCP metrics on the Cobbprod01 and Cobbprod02 (Cemcp29) e-mail servers, including high numbers of stray segments, retransmissions, receive window throttles, out of order segments, expired connections, etc.
We chased down several of these issues, and most ended up being communication issues between three main servers - cobbprod01, cobbprod02, and cobbtrav01 (a server for mobile devices).
Eventually, we decided to focus on the receive window throttles from cobbprod02 to cobbprod01, and retransmissions (and L7 Lotus data spikes) from cobbprod01 back to cobbprod02.
They mentioned they recently added ""link aggregation"" (dual NICs that were load-balanced). A poor configuration here could be causing problems. In any case, it appeared that more data was being sent to cobbprod02 than it could handle and it was sending out throttles to slow down incoming traffic from cobbprod01.
Why cobbprod01 was sending so many retransmissions is an outstanding issue.

This sounds like an excellent case for an Application Inspection Trigger. One trigger should be able to collect and display all of this information, except for the number of DB connections per server, and write it to a detail metric.
The number of DB connections would be a little trickier. It wouldn't know about existing connections, but could keep track of new connections as they come in, which might be all your DBA team needs.

Also, would you possibly have an example of the generic variables (such as ""i.e. id=1"") you mentioned? It would be good to see what you mean.

If you feel like taking a stab at it, we're happy to help. Otherwise, we'll see what we can come up with next week.

The current hypothesis about IFDS peculiarities.
CIFS
The screenshot of CIFS data sent yesterday was of the wrong view.  The client and server roles were mixed up.
Dan asks, 
why in this case, did clicking on the CIFS menu go to the uninteresting role view?  The little Server/Client dropdown is often overlooked.  Was there a reason the ExtraHop chose the less interesting role view?
FTP
The FTP data transfer is taking a long time which causes the FTP control channel to expire. Since the FTP Control Channel expires, the ExtraHop can not properly complete the FTP DATA processing.  That in turn means the FTP specific metrics stop accumulating.
However, all remaining transferred bytes are still accumulated toward the L7 metric of ""FTP"" and ""FTP-DATA"" simply because of the TCP Flow's ports in use.
The solution to test here is increasing the FTP timeout within the Running_Config.


The control channel expiration is the most plausible explanation for this. There should definitely be a ticket for this. In the meantime, increasing the idle timeout for FTP in the running config could be used as a temporary workaround:

    ""capture"": {
        ...
        ""app_proto"": {
            ""ftp"": {
                ""idle_timeout_classify"": <timeout value in seconds>
            }
        },

Glue Team,how to use show availability on summary?,11/8/12,,11/8/12 12:10,0,1,Microsoft - Advertising,20121108-03326,,"Email to Sam:

Hey Sam,

I've got the answers to your questions from last night.

Part 1: getting clarification of what the colors meant when switching to ""Show Availability"" on a Summary widget
If the widget is showing a metric for a device (or device group) and any alert has fired on that device (or device group) that color would refer to the severity of the alert. A key point to make is that the alert has to be in the same protocol as the metric being graphed; so even though you're graphing tcp established, the alert may have been on tcp rtt.


Part 2: using the ""Show Availability"" information elsewhere
So as of right now, the information displayed by using ""Show Availability"" is only available in Summary widgets, Flex Grids, and in Geomaps. You wouldn't be able to use it on a custom page.

Please let me know if I covered everything."

Amanda Tillman,GUI questions from Lily,11/26/12,,11/26/12 12:26,0,1,Cricket Communications,20121126-03380,,"1. Response times are recorded in ms, that's the best resolution. However anytime we ""do math"" (i.e. calculate standard deviation, mean, etc) to the data, there is the possibility that the result comes out in tenths. That's probably what he's seeing. We are also tracking an enhancement for sub-millisecond measurements, and will have to wait to see how that turns out.

2. Datasets have more granular stats than sample sets. When you access a device on the summary page, a dataset is being used, but when you drill in on a device sample sets are used instead. If you want the min/25th/50th/75th/max stats for a specific device, you can always write a trigger and create a custom page/graph that will give you that will use the dataset and give that specific information.

(Side note: usually database transactions are so fast that making this configuration still may not give you the information you're looking for in a DB stat. Again, we are looking into sub-millisecond recording, so this may be resolved in the future.)

3. Not sure what exactly is going on here, screenshots would help.

After reviewing your data here is a quick summary of the findings:

Observed high desync rate for all traffic.  Desyncs are an indication that there is packet loss on the data feed.  
L2 shows a max throughput around 600M even though we confirmed that the 10G port is being used for the feed.  This along with the desync rate also points to a data loss somewhere upstream.

Let me know if you need further assistance.

Tanya,

I looked into this again and I finally figured out what happened...

Unfortunately, right now when we change around one of our views (like in this case, TCP was changed around) and a user does an upgrade but had reports that used that view, there's a good chance that that report will break. That's what happened in this case... there is no longer a chart called ""rtoImg"" in the TCP view, so the report fails.

Deleting the problematic item(s) in the report and re-adding them should fix the problem.

Nagle delays are only displayed in the outbound section of L4 metrics since they can only be sent. You're seeing the count of all the outbound Nagle delays that the senders have sent out. Inbound Nagle delays would just look like regular packets, which is why there is no Nagle delay metric displayed in the group of inbound TCP stats.

--

The device level3-transit is a router, how it can report nagle delay ? please advise .

The Nagle delay is probably originating on the other side of this L3 device, coming from another device that we don't see in the SPAN.  If we don't see the specific device in the SPAN it will be associated with the interface on the L3 device since that's the first thing we can see."

There is a way to dodge this IP address issue. Another way to connect a second node to the ECM is to login to the node's admin page. Under settings, choose join a cluster. Fill in the ECM's detail's there, and the node will tunnel up to the ECM. If you want to preserve the node's customizations, make sure you uncheck the ""reset configuration"" box. Otherwise, the node's customizations will be reset to the configurations seen on the ECM.

When you add a node in 3.8 you are given an option to allow the node to keep its settings or you can clear them. 

If you allow the node to keep its own customizations, then the node's customizations will persist on the node but will not be pulled up to the ECM. As a result, the node customizations are not visible or modifiable from the ECM. 

Does that make sense?

This looks to be a bi-product of the way the ExtraHop creates that particular type of graph. 
We use 3 stat points to create the rate, however the first one is not shown. If you look lower in the PDF you do see a couple graphs that do have all 3 points, because they are graphing values and not creating a rate from those values. 

If the user pulls back to a 24 hour view, or were to view the fast stats, they will likely see the metrics that are missing. 

We have had a long standing ticket (#1675) open to figure out a better way to do this, but it isn't likely to be addressed in any immediate release.  

Hopefully that helps John.

I'll need a little more information to give you a definite answer. Do you happen to know what kind of encryption the third party uses? We didn't see any information regarding this on their website, so if you can find out we'll know for sure.

If they use SSL decryption, such as HTTPS, SSH, or other SSL-wrapped protocols, you'll need to get a hold of their private key(s). The keys can be loaded onto your ExtraHop, and from here we can decrypt the traffic and do full analysis up to L7.

If they use any other type of encryption, unfortunately we won't be able to decrypt so we can only do analysis up to L4.

Let me know if that makes sense and/or if you have any other questions!

Not being completely satisfied with my answer from before, I ran an API script that 
would pull the data from each group via the ECM. 

In Group A (Dreamworks group) the results that came back were Slow stats. 
In Group B (filter group) the results that came back were medium stats. 

The reason that Group A returned Slow stats is that we are trying to determine the best stat type to return for all the devices in the group. The Dreamworks group has over 5000 devices across 2 nodes. Some of these devices may not have Medium stats so we default to slow. Why might some of the devices be missing medium stats : They could be limited analysis devices during that window or a node that is busy and had medium stats rolled off."

I wanted to follow up with a potential solution to your question. You can set Protocol Classifications on the administration page under Admin > Capture > Protocol classification. You can read more about Protocol Classifications in the help menu (note you will need to change the URL to contain your device-specific hostname or IP):

https://<node hostname>/doc-admin/Default.htm#Capture/Protocol_Classification.htm

VOIP is not a protocol that we currently have a module for, however, you can categorize the destination ports used by your VIOP implementation as a single name. This will aggregate how the traffic is displayed and allow you to view it as one classification instead of separate UDP ports.

 
I have also reached out to Dan and the SE team. They are more familiar with your unique environment and may be able to provide other options.

Thank you"

The forum gurus are very keen on triggers and may be able to point you in the right direction.

If you would like direct help configuring solutions like unique triggers in your environment, we do offer a paid service through our System Architects that may be able to develop a solution for you.

Thank you
Nick

Kurt Shubert,SSL cert expiry,4/26/13,,4/26/13 5:13,0,1,International Financial Data Services (Canada) Limited,20130426-04048,,"Mario,

The reason that the cert only shows up on one of the reports is most likely a case of time and frequency.  Since the results only show active certs that were used during the time span of the report and the cert in question was only used two times in the report in which it shows, it probably was not actively being used in the time of the other report.  

To get the comparison you want, expand your time window on each report to at least 24 hours. That should get you decent coverage."

to Chris, support 
Chris, 

I escalated your support package to our development team, but we were still unable to pinpoint why the system became unresponsive. We have narrowed it down to the web services crashing due to not being able to allocate any additional memory resources, but the system was restarted prior to us being able to get a support pack so I cannot narrow down the process that was taking up all the memory for the web services. I can say that it appears the ability for the system to capture data was not affected by the web services outage so I do not believe you lost any visibility.

 I am glad you had a chance to update to 3.9. Like I mentioned before, it does have some additional improvements for trigger allocation as well as trigger UI. 

Please let me know if you have any additional concerns about this case.

Hello Larry,

I am glad that you are no longer seeing an issue on your system. If you like, I can schedule a quick WebEx to verify the issues are resolved on Thursday. Or if you prefer, you can upload a support pack and a system health report to our support portal:

To get a Support Pack:
1) on the Extrahop/admin page go to support packs (at the very bottom)
2) 'Execute' a Support pack
3) download the Complete support pack.

to download a system health report:
1) on the ExtraHop/extrahop page go to the settings in the top right.
2) Set the time interval to the last 7 days
3) Select the PDF option in the top right and save the generated PDF document.  

To upload files through our support portal:
1) login with your support account at http://www.extrahop.com/support/support-portal/
2) select 'Log a ticket' Tab
3) upload the files using the file upload option (you do not have to generate a new ticket if you do not want to).

Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns.

Hi Peter,

I have an update for the case opened with Samsung. Unfortunately, it looks like they have been updating their pseudo devices over the last two weeks on a fairly consistant basis. They would also restart excap during these updates. This may be responsible for the spikes in data, but it is hard to tell, because the running config is constantly changing. If the capture is restarted, there is a chance that the metrics during the restart process may be affected. Also, their psudo devices configured in their running config changes repeatedly during their timeframe:
Current Running config:

I have spent the day with Sam at Claris looking over their environment and continuing the build-out of the new deployment.  Sam has completed setting up ERSPAN for all of his VDS's, and none of the EH1000v's are beyond device safety limits.  

Also recall that Claris stood up a temporary ECM for testing, but I confirmed with him that it is no longer being used.  Their original ECM is performing very well now that the nodes are within healthy range of device counts.  They currently still have ""devices_across_captures"" (dedup) enabled on their ECM, but plan on setting it to false next week since it appears that it will no longer be needed.  I asked Sam to keep me updated on that.  

We were also successful deploying a vCenter integration script which has already proved to be helpful to them in several ways.

Sam is very pleased at this point, so we should be able to close the long-open case since their environment is healthy and the ECM is once again performant.

Thanks,

Nick Sturza,ING Direct:  Cannot get SMTP working,5/21/13,,5/9/13 10:05,0,1,Capital One Services LLC,20130509-04128,,"Hello Zack,

Yes, the package provided restarted a notification service that was running, but apparently not working correctly. This is not a usual occurrence and there is no simple way to restart this service through the UI without completely restarting your system (or in your case we provided you a specialized support package that restarted the service). I had verified that the service was running when we started working on your case so I did not believe it was the culprit until we had ruled out other possibilities. I am glad this resolved the issue.

I am going to review the Support package you uploaded with our Dev team to see if we can track down 'why' this service was not functioning correctly, but I do not foresee this problem returning. Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns about your environment. Feel free to reach out to support at support@extrahop.com or (877) 333 9872 ext.2

1) Span moved from node 1 to node 3.
3) there is an F5 device that was doing the SSL decryption so there was never any decryption of the URI done by the EH device.
3) node 3 Could see the traffic (Once user connected directly to correct node we were able to verify that the SPAN was still showing the expected traffic).
4) On the ECM, the trigger / device groups configured for the SSL / URI metrics were configured as Static device groups. Since devices on an ECM are unique to the Node in the database and the device group was static, I had to have Sheila Re-Add the devices to the static device group and reassign the trigger to get the environment active again. I mentioned to LexisNexis that a Dynamic device group would not have this limitation, but it was explained to me that this was the only way that we could define the device group.

After adding the new devices (as discovered on node 3) to the static device group, the trigger started working again.

There were also some questions brought up in the call about the EH8000 and 20Gb limits. May be worth reaching out to bill to talk about SSL from EH and our new product lines.

Factual notes:
- Jihun Kim showed me the current and desired displays (see below)

    The default display is in bytes/s (that's the data available to the trigger)
    Mental conversion from bytes/s to bits/s is not convenient, because user has to divide by 8
    The trigger is currently doing conversion from bytes/s to Kbits/s and Mbits/s
    That has the rounding issue, when rates go under 1

- Jihun re-iterated that it was a deal-breaker from their perspective, because:

    Mental conversion within ExtraHop? is not convenient
    They would send EH reports to subsidiaries alongside reports from other products, so they should all use consistent units for comparison reasons.
    His boss thought it was an important issue to fix.

Acceptable functionality would be:

    Preferred: Allow an option to set the units to Kbps or Mbps for user's choice.
    Acceptable: System does the conversion to the unit that makes the most sense based on magnitude of the metric.

Nick Sturza,Duplicate Devices,5/17/13,,5/13/13 15:20,0,1,International Financial Data Services (Canada) Limited,20130513-04158,,"Hello Mario, 

It appears that the SPAN on node vm1 is unable to detect the VLAN for VMware 172.25.41.121. Do you know if VLAN tags are being stripped in your virtual environment? If there is no way to send the tags to ExtraHop node vm1, you can create a custom device group to aggregate the captured information about this device. The third option would be to change the running config to ignore vlans on IFDS' ExtraHop physical node, but this would reduce granularity and I wouldn't recommend this change unless there is a direct reason that a device group would not provide the visibility you require. 

If you like, I can discuss these options further. You can reach support at (877) 333 9872 ext 2 or I can set up a meeting to further explain your options.

Without changing anything you can view L7 traffic from the L7 Protocols section. Assuming that all your telnet traffic is using the default port (TCP 23) then your telnet sessions would be visible by selecting this Protocol from the L7 Protocols. 




If you are using multiple different ports for telnet, you can 'label' these ports as telnet via the admin screen.

From the Admin screen go to Capture,
On the Capture Screen choose Protocol Classifications.

I have reviewed the health of your ExtraHop system with the Extrahop Dev team and we believe that your EH5000 is still approaching a system threshold for inbound packets. It appears that the inbound packets are maxing out at near 1.3 million packets per second. 



Below are some additional steps you can take to improve the system health of your ExtraHop system: 

1) Disable unused triggers and alerts. 
Look at default alerts on the system's ExtraHop => Settings => Alerts page. There are default alerts shipped with your ExtraHop system that may be enabled or configured for 'all devices.' Disabling unused alerts would help reduce the load on your ExtraHop system 
Look at the triggers that are configured on the system's ExtraHop => Settings => Triggers page. Try to disable any unused triggers or debugging in triggers that are functioning normally. You can also try to change the assignments of the triggers to only trigger from Devices or Device groups that utilize the trigger instead of assigning the trigger to all discovered devices. 
2) Review data feed to ExtraHop system and limit any unnecessary traffic from the SPAN being sent to the EH5000 system. 

3) I also want to let you know that we have a new system (EH6000) that provide enchanted capabilities over our older models. Lily would be able to provide additional information if you are interested. 

Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns. I can schedule also schedule a phone call or WebEx to expand on our findings.

bounded by the disks installed on the system.  We have been discussing future
features that may help.  I'm looping in Tanya if you'd like to discuss with
her.  I think she'd be interested to find out the driver for this.

Hello Bob,

I am still updating your case to forward it to development, but I want to provide an update for the work-around I suggested.

Here is a simple example to convert a Hex value to a decimal value and output it directly to the log file. I didn't include any error detection or use / case examples but it should get you started:

    /* Your Hex input value. if you are unsure what the IBMMQ value you are receiving is, you can write it directly to the log using log(hex.toString());
*/
    var hex = 'A1F211'
    //Use this to convert the hex to dec
    var dec = parseInt(hex,16);
    //write the new value to the log (note i also show an example to convert it to a string)
    log(dec.toString());

Here is what you should see in your log:

Nick Sturza,Duplicate Devices,6/21/13,,6/19/13 5:56,0,1,International Financial Data Services (Canada) Limited,20130619-04311,,"Hello Mario,

I looked further into the logs you provided. I noticed that the first device with IP 192.168.32.26 and VLAN tag of 15 was discovered 2-22-2013, but the second device with the IP 192.168.32.26 and the vlan tag 14 was discovered 05-02-2013. The devices with the IP address 192.168.32.27 follow the same pattern. It appears that there was a change in the information being provided to your ExtraHop Hardware Node at or around this time. Researching this change may provide visibility into why there are multiple VLAN tags for these IP addresses. 

There is an additional option that would require a change to the configuration of your ExtraHop system. If you enable 'Devices Across VLANs,' on your ExtraHop Hardware Node, Your ExtraHop system can be configured to ignore VLAN tags. However, this will set all the VLAN tags to '0' in the Network Metrics for your Hardware Node and reduce the visibility into VLAN tags on your extraHop system, and I don't think this is what you are looking for.

 To make this change, you would change:
""devices_across_vlans"": false, 
to 
""devices_across_vlans"": true, 
in the ExtraHop running configuration for the ExtraHop Node that has discovered these devices. In your case it is your ExtraHop Hardware Node Serial: 43RD5P1.

Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns.

Thank you

Hello Mario,

By Default, the ExtraHop system is set up to discover devices based upon IP address and VLAN tag.The ExtraHop system uses this information to assign the device ID. This means you will have one Device for each VLAN associated with an IP address.

Thank you

I am glad this was able to resolve your issue with modifying SNMP. I had a chance to review your configuration question with the support team. If the exact same packets tagged with the exact same VLAN are sent to the ExtraHop system via multiple capture interfaces, the additional packets will count against packet count and throughput on that interface, but will show up as retransmissions. This means that your L7 Metrics (protocol classification) would be fine, but you may have issues with high retransmission metrics in your L4 metrics.

We have a POC running with LoadSpring here in Boston, and we're trying to do some SSL decryption.

The customer had a bit of a hard time getting the key/cert pair for us.  When I watched him try to export it from the IIS server, the ""include private key"" option was greyed out.  A quick google search says this is a function of how the cert was added, and you need to find the original PFX file to overcome this.

After this call, the customer somehow found a file that he was able to insert, but it didn't seem to decrypt anything.  I had him delete and re-add it while I was watching, to make sure he did it right, and it still is not decrypting anything.

I'm guessing that the cert he is adding is not the right one, but I don't see any way to tell for sure.

When I look under the SSL group, it seems all we can see is the cert subject and expiration date.

When we look at the SSL cert we added, we can see validity period and some identifiers that don't seem to be present on the SSL server group side.

The question is, how can I prove/disprove that he has added the wrong cert?

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks!

It may be possible to narrow down the specific client by utilizing database metrics for a specific database server if you have a timeframe for when the stored procedure occurred, the database that it referenced, the method that was called, and the database server that was queried. 

1) Select the Database server by MAC address, Hostname, or IP address from the devices list. 

2) Set the timeframe to the estimated time window for when the stored procedure was called. 

3) Select Database Metrics and review the method utilized by the stored procedure. 

4) Set the Database that the stored procedure is calling on the database server. 


This will give you a list of Clients that Have utilized that specific method for that database on this database server for the timeframe selected.

I had a chance to review the issue that occured on your ExtraHop system with the ExtraHop support team. It appears your system encountered a known issue that was addressed in the latest firmware release. I believe that an upgrade to the 3.9 firmware will prevent this issue from occurring in the future. Until you are able to upgrade, you may follow the same steps I provided in order to recover from this event.

Work-around:
1) login to the console session
2) type enable and provide the enable password
3) type restart exportal to restart the exportal process on the affected system.

I can explain the device in question as well as confirm that L2 (throughput / packets) should show up for limited analysis devices. Devices on your system are discovered by IP address and VLAN. The device in question (199.19.134.35) is being detected across multiple VLANs with the same IP. Because of this, there are actually 4 unique devices off this IP address:
Inline image 2
If we drill into the discovered device that has no vlan tag, we can see that it is in full analysis mode:
Inline image 3
We can see the L2 stats for the last 30 minutes on this device:
Inline image 4
If we drill into one of the devices that saw this traffic with VLAN tag:
Inline image 5
We can see that there was no traffic for this IP on this VLAN over the last 30 minutes:
Inline image 6

Hopefully this explains this unique situation. An option would be to create a static device group off the IP address or subnets you want to combine into one device and use this to reference the 'complete picture' of all vlans at a given point in time. If you would like, I can explain further when you have time.  Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns.

You are correct.  The difference in the 3.9 firmware you are now running is that any devices discovered after the safety limit is reached will drop into ""Limited Analysis Mode"" and will only collect L2 metrics.  This is to prevent the box from falling over if you send it data from too many devices.  Here is a link to the docs on the forum if you want to read about the specifics of Device Limits.  https://forum.extrahop.com/static/WebUI_Users_Guide.pdf#56

Jared Nunn,Lookback Time,8/9/13,LIC-001431,8/7/13 15:16,0,1,Seattle Children's Hospital,20130807-04574,,"Hi Bruce,

The Support and Engineering teams have been talking over your support case with me.  Here's what we've got for you:

Your ExtraHop is designed to deliver 30 days of total lookback provided it stays within the specified allowances (for the EH5000 system, 10Gb/sec of throughput, 3000 devices). The amount of fast stats will depend on the rate at which data is being written to the datastore. Currently, your ExtraHop has about 6,800 active devices and is pushing a lot of data to the datastore. With the high throughput and device count on this appliance, 20 hours of fast stats is not unexpected, and ~26 days of total lookback is also expected.

Depending on the metric type and time intervals you are viewing, long load times may be explained by the high device count as well. Our engineering team is currently working with Zach Pohlman to research the root cause of long load times in your environment and ECM.

That said, we've got some performance improvements pending in the 3.10 release which may speed things up, and may also increase lookback.  This release is in final QA, and we anticipate a release this month.

I'd love to catch up with you post your presentation.  Rob said it went well?

zdp."

I wanted to provide a quick summary of our findings from this mornings meeting with Mitch. At a 24-hour window, we are only seeing <0.1% of IBMMQ traffic as unclassified. At a 6-hour window, all IBMMQ traffic is classified. Mitch explained to me that a configuration change at the Anue took place sometime yesterday evening. We believe this has resolved the issue. Configuration on the ExtraHop admin side appears correct. If any unclassified traffic appears in the next 24 hours, we will begin to dig deeper with a system diagnostic pack. Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns."

The output of our customizations upload is verbose and can be a bit confusing, especially when transferring customizations from one  system to another. The message about not finding the capture refers to the Extrahop itself and means that the MAC address of the current capture port does not match that which was saved in the customizations. This is true when applying customizations from one ExtraHop to another.  The actual objects are still created, but the assignments are unable to be done. We do not make assumptions about the assignments and will only do exact matches.

The Triggers that create the applications were loaded (see below). These triggers will probably need to be assigned to the new capture/network interface. 

Skipped importing trigger (Sample HTTP Application).
A corresponding trigger already exists.

Skipped importing trigger (Sample DB Application).
A corresponding trigger already exists.

Restored 12 triggers.



Now that you have loaded the triggers and other custom objects, they will need to be assigned to the capture and possibly the devices so that they will create the applications you are expecting to see. 

Please verify that the triggers are loaded and can be assigned."

Jared Nunn,Datastore lookback question,9/26/13,,9/26/13 8:09,0,1,Allscripts,20130926-05005,,"Bruce,

I'm not exactly sure what you are after when you refer to a ""predictor of baselining capacity"" so let me explain the lookback and you can see if it matches what you are after.

Lookback is derived based on the current data feed to the ExtraHop system, and the capacity of the datastore. It is an estimate of the different buckets of granularity we use to store metrics.  Fast stats are stats that are available at a 30 second data point granularity.  As the data gets older. the 30 second point are combined into 5 minute data points, those are the Medium stats and eventually we aggregate this into one hour points, Slow stats.  The retention time at each level of granularity can be estimated based on the size of the datastore and the volume/rate of the incoming traffic.  This will change as the incoming data feed fluctuates so the number will not always be the same. 

As an example your EH1 will show data as follows:

30 second data points will be displayed back ~3.9 days
5 minute aggregate points will be displayed between ~3.9 days and ~14.4 days
1 hour aggregate data points will be displayed for data older than ~14.4 days 
Total lookback is ~2.7 months   

I hope this makes sense and answers your question.

Regards,
Kurt Shubert

I wanted to help you out with the question you recently sent to my colleague Jared Nunn regarding filtering devices. The filter utilizes Regular Expressions to search, I've included a brief cheat sheet regarding commonly used Regular Expressions below:

http://regexlib.com/CheatSheet.aspx

So in your example, if you wanted to filter it to search for either Server1 or Server2, you would put the following in the filter:

/Server1|Server2/

Note that if you want to use Regex filters like this in the search box, make sure you put a forward slash (""/"") on either side of the criteria. Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Best,
Amanda"

They are going to do some internal work to better understand their issues and take some edge captures we may get to look at.  Part of the plan for going with ERSPAN was because there was some ZEN servers in the same infrastructure which we would RSPAN traffic from.  Unfortunately the pre work to allow RSPAN to be configured on the Zen servers has proven unstable and has been backed out.

It is very likely due to infrastructure and software limitations in this environment that we will move back to standard span at the enclosure switches with Gigamon providing aggregation and filtering until they can resolve some of their internal issues.

Please close this case for now."

I can confirm that 3.10.18980 is supported on your hardware. You will need to use the 'Complete' firmware release in order to update from 3.8 to 3.10. Please see below to the direct link to this firmware update. 

ftp://tradermedia:eequaepu@ftp.extrahop.com/firmware/latest/complete/extrahop-complete-3.10.18980.tar

You can read more about the firmware update process in the Admin UI document on the ExtraHop Form:

https://forum.extrahop.com/static/AdminUI_Users_Guide.pdf#nameddest=Firmware

Please note, the upgrade process from 3.8 to 3.10 may take an extended period of time (2+ hours) due to a database migration. This is completely depending on the system being upgraded. Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns. Feel free to contact extrahop support at support@extrahop.com or +44 (0)845 5199150 at anytime.

I reviewed the screen shots you provided. I don't think the alert that you are currently using is measuring the value you want. Right now, you are measuring the 25th percentile during a specific hour of a specific week increasing by 150% of trend and weighing it vs the overall trend value over the whole 5 week period.

In order for your current trend to fire, the lowest 25% of your samples would need to be above 150% of their overall average during a 15 minute window. I believe there is a simpler way to alert on the events you are trying to measure. 

Below is my suggestion to be notified on these events in the future. The alert below will fire when the mean (average) bytes_in over 15 minutes is greater than 150% of trend. The trend is set for the same hour of the week, looking back 5 weeks, with a weighted average to the last week (this means that the more recent weeks will affect the trend line more than old weeks).
Inline image 1
Inline image 2

you can view the current status, (and the trend line) of a trend based alert by looking at the alert history on your pseudo device. This may help you fine-tune these alerts in the future:







Below is a brief explanation of trend Weighting models and their uses on the ExtraHop forum. The forum is a great place to get input from other ExtraHop users on how to set up alerts, triggers or other customizations.

Nick Sturza,Difference between URI and URL,2/25/14,,2/25/14 8:48,0,1,Purdue Pharma Technologies Inc.,20140225-05717,,"URI-
A URI identifies a resource either by location, or a name, or both. More often than not, most of us use URIs that defines a location to a resource. A URI has two specializations known as URL and URN.
URL-
A URL is a specialization of URI that defines the network location of a specific resource. Unlike a URN, the URL defines how the resource can be obtained. We use URLs every day in the form of http://damnhandy.com, etc. But a URL doesn’t have to be an HTTP URL, it can be ftp://damnhandy.com, smb://damnhandy.com, etc.
URN-
A URI identifies a resource by name in a given namespace but not define how the resource maybe obtained. This type of URI is called a URN. You may see URNs used in XML Schema documents to define a namespace, usually using a syntax such as:
<xsd:schema xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema""
            xmlns:xsd=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema""
            targetNamespace=""urn:example""

Here the targetNamespace use a URN. It defines an identifier to the namespace, but it does not define a location.

You can read more about these definitions on the blog below:

Currently, there is no direct method for getting the data from an activity map to an Excel spreadsheet.  However, you may be able to see what you are looking for in the L3 section.  You can export the peer devices under L3 to a spreadsheet (Right-click -> Export to Excel) and then filter by unique 'Device' name.  This will show you all the activity within your span.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,"

Yes, I have been going through the process to move the ECM to the data center.  Sorry I haven't updated you.  I expected to hear something yesterday, but haven't been contacted for the .ova file yet.  My request was approved to go to the VMWare team, and that's where it is sitting for now. 

I believe I can navigate the process without having you ship a physical box for the ECM.  I just have to navigate 'the process'...which is not documented and is trickier than passing data between Python and Javascript :-) 

Thanks again for your diligence on this.  I'll plan to continue to manually update the licenses as the deployment process progresses... knowing we will have a nice solution."
Nick Sturza,Exclude_MAC in running config,3/6/14,,2/27/14 8:16,0,1,Middlesex Hospital,20140227-05743,,"Hello PM,

I finished my WebEx with middlesex Hospital and have a follow-up enhancement request on their behalf. Currently Middlsex has two separate incidents where being able to exclude an IP or subnet would help them remove unnecessary noise on their ExtraHop system. This is a low priority request, but I did let them know that I would forward it on to the Product Management team. 

First scenario = VPN endpoint. Due to the way we limit visibility by the Exclude MAC, the devices on the other side of their VPN end point are still discovered (in this case by the 'next hop' before the ExtraHop span). It would be beneficial if they could exclude these devices due to the way DNS discovery works for this Juniper device. Basicly, it forwards all the DNS requests of these clients to internal Middlesex DNS servers and there is no way to prevent this.

Second scenario = Broken application. I personally see this as a 'good' thing that they cannot remove visibility into this issue. but there is a broken application that creates FTP errors in their environment. This time the application in question sits on a physical server, but the clients communicate via a blade switch that spans their physical and virtual environments so when Middlesex excluded the device by MAC, it was still discovered due to client / server interaction not involving the mac address.

Both scenarios could benefit from the ability to exclude IP or subnets from the ExtraHop Capture. I let the customer know that I would forward on their enhancement request to the product management team. The customer appeared happy and not very concerned about a timeline for this request. Please let me know if you need any additional information. 

thank you
Nick Sturza"

Please do not distribute externally: 

I had a 20ish minute webex with Derek, I modified the default pages for the bundle slightly by changing the layout and added more visibility into the custom detail metrics collected. I also made sure the GeoMap was working. Everything looks great and Derek wants to give kudos to the ExtraHop team for putting this visibility out there so quickly. He did detect some unexpected communication from external IPs so he will be using the ExtraHop to create a report to send to his security team for further analysis.

Morgan had an upgrade issue where there was insufficient space on the upgrade drive that was not caught by the Installer. We have filed tickets for this :  Ticket 5921 , Ticket 5922 , Ticket 5923 Ticket 5425

This caused an issue that put their portal db into an odd partially updated state.  

Nick and I worked to get their ExtraHop up by resetting the portal db via the support account. This made the ExtraHop available but Greg noticed after a period of time that the device and activity was not being updated. Many devices appeared to be in Limited Analysis, despite having enough room in the device Limit as well as activity prior to the upgrade. 

The issue was that the portal process was not syncing the metric time and state data from the datastore.  We gave Greg a couple steps we hoped would solve this, which actually solved itself on Saturday. I believe he decided to reboot the system prior to noticing this, which ended up in the failed update state today because of a file remnant left over for the failed update last week that I forgot to remove when fixing the issue. 

Today we figured out the root cause for the data to not get updated. When we did the portal reset, it clears the packet capture meta data from the portal db. The portal process goes through and recreates this meta data. When we have tested this in the past we made sure that the UI was not blocked by this activity. It is not. What we hadn't noticed was that this process blocks the datastore to portaldb sync process.  Ticket 6124 

Morgan Stanley had over 6 million packet capture files.It turns out  this will take about  6 days to completely recreate the meta data.  Greg did try to delete from files before but has run into deleting issues when large numbers (  > tens of thousands)  are being removed.

We have a couple tickets in to improve the packet capture deletion process as well as handling for large packet capture counts. Ticket 4198 Ticket 4209  Ticket 6130  Ticket 6132"

You can check to see what your trigger session table size, and your session
timeout timer are set to in the running config of your ExtraHop.  To check
this, browse to Settings -> Administration -> Running Config -> Edit.

For the trigger session table size, look for something like this:

""capture"": {

   ""jssession_table_size"": 32768
}

For the session timeout timer, look for something like this:

{

    ""session"": {

        ""lifetime"": 654321

    }
}

Let me know if you have any questions.

Even though the initial deal size may be small, this account may represent a significant opportunity down the road and we really don’t want to concede this business to Netscout. 

Brian - How much time can you buy us from an account management perspective? Is it possible to let Netscout go first in the bake-off, while we finalize the support? 

Matt - Heads up… We’ll need to lean heavily on you in this deployment, as initial KVM support we bring to the table is unlikely to be well-documented.

---- 

Had a call today with Landon, Danny from Qualtrics (Tanya/Ryan/Brent)

Notes: 
* Customer is extremely friendly and flexible - great prospect for early-access rough KVM packaging with no documentation
* Deployment
	- Would like an appliance to run on KVM for the purposes of monitoring physical traffic
	- There is no virtual switching and intra-VM virtual traffic — all KVM traffic hits the physical switch
	- Do not have a method in mind for getting physical traffic into KVM. Two options are:
		* Direct SPAN (would put the virtual switch into promiscuous mode, Ryan has done that)
		* ERSPAN (didn’t know much about that option, but will research it)
			- Brocade FCS switches
			- HP chassis, virtual connect with NICs
* Throughput/Capacity
	- Brian previously said it was going to be 3x1000vs
	- Landon confirmed they have less than 1G of traffic
* Packaging
	- NICs/Disk - prefer virtio (predictably, as it’s native), but it’s not a hard requirement (which is good, because we don’t support it today and supporting it would require engineering work)
	- Flexible on packaging, ISO might be fine

Next steps:
* Tanya/Brent/Bhushan/Kat to meet on Friday to discuss next steps
	- Immediate: Packaging, installation, documentation - what can we do to make this process easier?
	- Longer-term: Engineering assessment for adding native support for virtio drivers - is this required for us to claim “KVM support”?"

It appears from these tests that the current ExtraHop LDAP authentication settings is limited to a single fully qualified domain. This means you cannot authenticate multiple child domain accounts when the parent domain is set as the base. I am going to file an enhancement request with the ExtraHop development team to look into this request further. 

As we tested earlier in the meeting, it is possible for you to set either child domain as the base from active directory authentication.

I looked further into the ExtraHop outage at the end of our meeting. It does not appear that the capture was effected and the outage lasted for around 10 minutes. I escalated the events to the development team, but we did not locate a root cause. I have not seen this issue occur with the firmware release that you are currently using, please let us know if this event occurs again in the future."

Thank you for the support pack and screenshots. It appears that your Base DN is misconfigured. The Base DN is the starting point for user searches. It needs to be either the domain itself, or an OU within the domain that contains all users that will have access to the ExtraHop.

Email: support@extrahop.com

Phone: 877-333-9872 (US) or +44 (0)845 5199150 (EMEA), extension 2

Support portal: https://www.extrahop.com/support/portal/overview/ Click the orange ""Support"" link or the ""Log a Case"" link on the right side column to get to the case creation page. This option requires a Support portal account, which can be obtained by sending an email to support@extrahop.com to request an account.

In addition to a description of the issue you wish to create the case for, it is also helpful to have the product key for the ExtraHop device involved.

All traffic is run through the HTTP parser which checks for known HTTP methods (i.e. GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. as well as a comprehensive list of rarely used HTTP methods). If one of these HTTP methods is found, that traffic is classified as HTTP traffic.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Team,
 
The network team will be performing changes to fix how extahop is delivering data. We may see a gap for 1 hour and it will be a couple of hours while they get this completed.
Jeff will indicate back to us once they are completed.

Thank you for for reaching out to us with these questions. See our answers in line.

1) Can we increase the verbosity of audit log (or) setup some other logging to track user activities in-depth?
 
The ExtraHop system can be set up to monitor itself. You will want to first create a compatible private certificate to upload onto your ExtraHop systems.  You may already have a system set up to generate these PK that will allow you to create a new private certificate for the ExtraHop system. Once it is created, you will first need to upload the cert to enhance the security of your ExtraHop. You can do so on the https://<ExtraHop IP>//admin/cert/ page.

Second, you will then want to upload this same certificate to the ExtraHop that will be monitoring your ExtraHop management interfaces. You can upload the PK on the https://<ExtraHop IP>/admin/capture/ssl_keys/  page and associate it with HTTPS (TCP 443) traffic.

We can schedule a follow-up to test and implement this functionality. At minimum, you would want to have an ExtraHop system setup with its management interface as part of its data feed and a private key file we can use to update the SSL cert on the ExtraHop system. These two items will be required to set up this functionality. 

2)  Is there a way to disable the packet capture feature completely?

It is possible to disable the license for the packet capture feature with ExtraHop support. This would remove this feature from your ExtraHop system until an ExtraHop support representative re-enables this module on our license server.

This feature writes the packet capture files to a dedicated SSD drive. You can remove the SSD drive and this feature will not work until the drive is re-installed and initialized in the admin UI. 

Please let me know if you have any additional questions.

thank you"

I am going to close this case. I evaluated the support pack over the last week and re-reviewed the logs with the development team. According to the logs, the capture was offline for around 10 minutes and then restarted. I did not see a capture crash or anything that looks like a stability problem on the ExtraHop side. It looks like the datafeed may have been offline or disrupted for an unexpected reason. The issue has not reoccured since the event and we have sense updated this system to the latest release of 4.1. 

If another event occurs, please let us know immediately.

Thank you
Nick Sturza"

Was about to be escalated but after speaking to Matt Berkstresser it was unnecessary to do so; there is already a Jira ticket for this sort of issue so glue team are aware.

Account:   Worldstrides  
Reporter:  aragothaman@extrahop.com
Device:   EH6100 (Physical)
Serial:     FM1H082
Firmware:  5.0.2.27598

Remote access: Yes (setup)
Atlas node:  ecm-14
Host cluster node:   WorldStrides_TW6F

Issue: ""Missing all dashboards (including default System Dashboards ~ 'Activity' & 'Network') and cannot _apply_ any bundles""
Importing a very basic bundle (1 dashboard only) ""EXA Sizing_v3.1"" results in the error message: Failed to import bundle: Folder matching query does not exist.
​Having downloaded the complete support pack of the problematic EH appliance (https://hermes.sea.i.extrahop.com/data/customers/Worldstrides/20151228/results/log/extrahop/) I found that these errors were reflected in the Extrahop specific logs ""examf.err"" and ""exportal"" on the 22nd December which was when hotfix 5.0.2.27598 was applied.
Verbose: exportal:Dec 28 11:57:09 extrahop examf: Thread-10: config.applyBundle error Traceback (most recent call last):   File ""./api/base.py"", line 642, in _dispatch_local_async   File ""/extrahop/lib/python/django/utils/decorators.py"", line 145, in inner     return func(*args, **kwargs)   File ""./config/service.py"", line 1945, in applyBundle   File ""./bundles.py"", line 43, in import_bundle   File ""./customizations.py"", line 1097, in restore   File ""./customizations.py"", line 1334, in validate_folder_items   File ""/extrahop/lib/python/django/db/models/query.py"", line 334, in get     self.model._meta.object_name DoesNotExist: Folder matching query does not exist.
Attempting to create a dashboard via the ""+ New Dashboard"" button in the bottom left (within side panel) allows the initial creation of the dashboard (Description, Theme, etc) and then appears to accept the input (assuming that the dashboard name is unique). The ""Layout Mode"" is then entered however no initial region is created, the ""Region"" option is not selectable at the bottom to begin creating a dashboard (nor are the other options!), and the Dashboard name is not listed on the side panel. 
I can confirm that these empty dashboards are committed to the EH appliance's customisations file.
I can however create folders that are listed in the side panel but do not permit the creation of a dashboard underneath. 
From examining the ""portaldb"" database (psql portaldb_Worldstrides_FM1H082_20151228) it appears there are entries missing from the ""summary_folder"" table. Having examined this particular table from a correctly behaving EH1000v (standard Dashboards) running on my Macbook it appears as if the problematic EH6100P is missing entries such as: 
 id |  author  |              description              |       name        | index | owner_id | mutable 
----+----------+---------------------------------------+-------------------+-------+----------+---------
  1 | ExtraHop | Folder for incoming shared dashboards | Dashboard Inbox   |     0 |        2 | f
  2 | ExtraHop | Folder for user-created dashboards    | My Dashboards     |     1 |        2 | f
  3 | ExtraHop | Folder for system-created dashboards  | System Dashboards |     2 |        2 | f
  ...
Reproduction: Unknown. I cannot determine the actions necessary for removing dashboard functionality. I have asked the Archana if this behaviour was present _before_ the EH6100P was upgraded to hotfix 5.0.2 and am awaiting a response.

Screenshots:

​

Workaround: Unknown. I've attempted importing an operational ""Dashboard"" JSON stanza customisation on the problematic EH6000P to no avail. In addition to this i've exported a functional bundel from a fresh EH1000v (ExtraHop Essentials) that resulted in the same errors

As mentioned in my email to Archana, the problematic EH appliance in question (EH6100P) has only just been operational over the past week. With that in mind as well as the assumption that the captured traffic so far is *disposable* would a datastore reset be able to resolve this issue.

Sorry for the delay on updating this specific case. It is a duplicate in our system the original case is 20160810-21212. We right now have applied a vlan tag to the second management interface and are working with Ganesh to get static routes defined for the specific applications and systems that need to interact with the ExtraHop system. I am going to close this case and we will continue to update 20160810-21212 with our progress.

thank you

Thanks for jumping on . Managed to get the setup password and for some reason the enable configuration required the setup account password and it all worked out . 

I am just leaving the store finally . The store is confident they wouldn't need to re- ip the box in ages so hopefully they should be good for a while even without a working front panel . 

Thanks and have a good rest of the day .

“What is the source for the dashboard in the second screenshot? If it is an application or a device, could you navigate to the SSL metrics and check the Certificates information to confirm that the certificate being used to encrypt those connections is the same as the one you configured?”

Customer provided the information and Walker responded:

“The 'unsupported' flag there means that the cipher suite is not able to be decrypted by traditional means because it uses a perfect forward secrecy key exchange algorithm. This is usually Diffie-Hellman or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (DHE or ECDHE in the 'Cipher Suites' section of the SSL metrics). This means that you not not only need the certificate and private key information to decrypt, but stateful information determined at negotiation time by the client and the server.”

What application is underneath this particular set of traffic that you would like to decrypt? Do you have any details on the types of servers it is being run on?””

Customer responded that he only knew it was a java application and requested the case to be closed."

Khaled Anntar,EXA EXReceiver service stopped,8/24/17,,8/14/17 23:53,0,1,Bank of Queensland - Home Limited,20170815-33245,,"EXA exreceiver  stopped
EDA was not pulling any information and that the reciever was not running was due to an invalid license state on the exa.
 Re-applying the license (causing the EXreceiver to restart), and then seeing it go down again after ~45 minutes ...
 and then re-applying the license again...etc.. 
 Existing red indices were removed, verified the license status, and checked the system health pages of both EDAs connected 
 to the EXA for rate of records being sent. It appears that the total rate was right around the range (20-30,000 records 
 per second) where we might start to experience issues with the EXA being overloaded, especially during times where concurrent
EXA queries are being made. Because of this, EXA records were disabled on one of the EDAs in order to reduce the rate. 
As you mentioned, reapplying the license (causing the exreceiver process to restart) on the EXA appeared to have helped
this issue temporarily. Our next step is to confirm that the EXA does not start throwing query errors after about 45 minutes,
and continue to monitor the EXA and confirm it stays in a good state over the next several days.

After we disabled the flows coming from one of the EDA's the issue never re-appeared..so it sure looks like EXA being overloaded.
Daniel ended up enabling the the flows from that EDA again, but this time disabled Automatic Flow Records and the issue never reoccured either."

This is typically because they are not physically connected (cabled) or the far side (switch) port is not enabled/configured.

 

Next Steps:

Insure the ExtraHop monitor ports are correctly physically cabled from the source switch(es) or Span Aggregation solution port(s).

Insure the source switch(es) or Span Aggregation solution port(s) are configured and enabled to send traffic to the ExtraHop.

 

When cabled, enabled, and configured the ports will show in the diagram as green (linked) and the link lights on the interfaces (on the appliance’s back side) will be light.

 

Insure the packet feed (SPAN/SPAN Aggregation is forwarding traffic tot he interface(s).

I am going loop the work we did today into this ticket. Today we provided direct development access to your EXA cluster and were able to stabilize the cluster for the short term. As part of your maintenance, you are trying to migrate 5 EXA nodes to be on the same side of a core switch. As we found out over the weekend, this caused instability for the overall cluster for the following reasons.

1) We did not stop writing new records putting additional stress that was split across 14 nodes in the cluster against 9 nodes.
2) The automated cleanup processes fell behind resulting in further stress on the remaining nodes. 
3) These performance issues caused the UI and communication to the EXA nodes to degrade to the point where the entire cluster was not responsive.
In order  address this problem and continue with the planned migration, I worked with development to preform the following emergency maintenance this afternoon:

1) We deleted any data from September to clean up additional space and reduce the need to clean up the reduced performance of a 9 node cluster compared to a 14 node cluster.
2) We turned off replication (replication level of 0 ) to reduce overhead of shard reallocation and redundancy. This also frees up space for additional look back during this migration.
3) We resolved communication issues between nodes *.188 and *.169 by restarting the back-end communication processes.
4) We removed the dedicated master node from the configuration settings because it does not have data and should not be directly responding to record search queries.

At this time,  the EXA cluster is now functioning as expected during the maintenance. We still need to finish this migration and address the problems listed below:

1) Add the 5 removed nodes back to the EXA cluster after redeploying. These will be blank nodes added to the cluster, we are not migrating the existing nodes.
2) Verify the proper placement of Master and backup master nodes once the cluster is restored to the 14 node size.
3) Turn shard replication level back to at least 1. This will probably cause an outage and ExtraHop will need to research the best path forward before scheduling this maintenance. 
4) Resolve the ECA and EDA admin UI issues where removed nodes are still showing as 'available for management'. This setting is different that nodes that are 'available for queries, search and use' and at the moment does not need to be addressed until the cluster is configured in the end state.


Please let me know if you think I missed anything. I am going to close this specific case related to improving performance. We will continue to assist you with the remaining steps as they are scheduled in your environment."

Hi John,

The recently released 7.1.2.1593 firmware build contains a fix for a known issue with ECAs displaying improper IP addresses for EDAs in their cluster. This firmware build is available on the customer portal at https://customer.extrahop.com/downloads/firmware/ <https://customer.extrahop.com/downloads/firmware/>. Please let me know if you have any questions, or if the issue persists after the firmware upgrade and we can troubleshoot further. 

Thanks,

Jordan Brengman
Sr. Support Engineer

Bad disk replaced and is on its way back to you.

Nick helped with a factory reset - with the correct firmware 6.1.0.1955, 
instead of the attached rescue flash drive which had 6.1.2.20xx

We're back online and getting data - so from my perspective this case is 
done and can be closed - thx ...

We had a couple of competing issues going on here. First the UI had an issue presenting alerts and blocking your ability to see alert assignments or view alerts in the html 5 UI. This is ticketed as EX-23561, EX-21965 and EX-23330. We provided targeted support packs to fix these issues, and the UI problems should be resolved in 7.0.2 which is now available on the support portal.

Today we did more investigation with the alerts that quit firing. As we found out, you had a single exclusion interval from Monday at 1 AM till Friday at 6 AM that appears to be the culprit. We will let PM know to improve the design with the Flash to HTML5 UI redesign, but for now you will have to do 5 separate exclusion intervals to represent Monday through Friday 1 am to 6 am.

I am going to see if completely restarting an EDA or ECA stops exclusion intervals from working for a short time or if this was just a coincidence. Either way, we do not believe the alert issue will return."

To fix this on another EDA, you will want to copy and paste ""tcp_dedup_use_l2"": true into the ""capture"" section of the running config. Here's the explanation of this setting from the internal running config guide:

""""""
When we see both sides of a firewall that rewrites TCP sequence numbers, this setting should be enabled. This will cause the capture to drop duplicated TCP packets without confusing the TCP sequence tracking code.
""""""

Please let me know if you have any questions or run into any further issues with this traffic being classified.

Thanks,

Jordan Brengman
Sr. Support Engineer

It will begin to balance the data evenly between all nodes to maximize performance, so the cluster is likely to be in yellow for a day and then it will move to green. 

I think we are good, but let's check back on it sometime tomorrow.

Hi Jason,

The EXA cluster now looks as expected. By chance, have you configured all 3 IP addresses in the EDA admin UI?

You can navigate to https://<ECA_IP>/admin > Connect Explore Appliances to verify. You will want to ensure that all 3 IPs are listed.

thanks"

I really think we should look at how they can break this EDA up into multiple EDAs with a large ECA in front.
The support case shows that they realize they are oversubscribed, but are concerned with the two datastore recoveries. This is by design. There are times when the block recovery will not determine that a block is in a bad state until it is directly acted upon. The second datastore recovery is run to address this. The bridge was under heavy load prior to the upgrade and some of the virtual block mappings were reporting potential issues prior to that upgrade.
They are also concerned with uptick in desyncs and drops after the upgrade. The desyncs come from increased capture memory pressure. We are more aggressive about cleaning up memory when the memory gets closer to full. Before the upgrade the system was hitting one of our capture safety limits and was about 1% under our aggressive memory sweep limit. After Nov 14 we started hitting our aggressive clear. The drops are occurring because the
Looking through the history contained in the diagnostic packs we see that they were having issues on the datastore and were hitting some memory safety nets on the capture before the upgrade on Nov 9. A few days after the upgrade, they began to have idle capture events. These idle capture events are related to stat sweeps on the dastastore taking longer. The sweeps are now taking over 60 seconds to complete so the bridge is too busy to handle new metrics from the capture. We likely were just below a threshold before Nov 12 and new applications, devices and metric objects have likely pushed the system across the threshold. Since the upgrade they have increased device count by about 100, applications by 31, both result in an increase in metrics associated to those objects as well.
I think it might be a good idea to look at what might have changed (either on a configuration from the ECA, the feed or elsewhere) on Nov 12 around 20:00 UTC.
More notes about the OverSubscription:
Lets compare the this EDA to another known loaded EDA 9100, Fiserv (keep in mind that 5500 is the device limit).
Total Device Count - HD:96K+, Fiserv: 34K+
Capture Device Count: HD:30K+, Fiserv:13K
Applications: HD:3000, Fiserv: 170
Unique Metrics: HD:2000, Fiserv:1600

Restore from backup caused the EDA to attempt a connection a license check connection through the ECA (which was no longer configured with the EDA). 

Removing the ECA config from the EDA seems to have resolved the license check-in issue.

--------------- Resolution Email to Contact ---------------
Hardware replacement complete and drops went away.

Closing this out as a hardware issue.

Hi Kam,

Have you added the IP addresses back to the ECA > Admin page under Connect ExtraHop Explore Appliances? If you have done so and you can see new data being sent to the Explore cluster and you can query new metrics, than you are complete and there is no need for a new support pack. The Green status and collecting new metrics is validation that the change is complete.

thank you,

Ray is reaching out to support because he is trying to decrypt HTTPS traffic and is unable to get the payload he wants.

--------------- Resolution Email to Contact ---------------
Hi Ray,

Thanks for spending the time to review triggers with me. As we found in the WebEx session. You're currently unable to decrypt the traffic you want because it is using the DHE Cypher Suite. I helped expand your test trigger to include certificate, fingerprint, client and server information to get more visibility. You can use this to work with your local contact to either change the Cypher Suite or utilize the TCP payload to get additional information. However, It didn't look like there was much payload at the moment.
We also reviewed the Trigger Flow store and Trigger Session table. You can read more in the trigger api guide here:

*         T=0 min: The number of DNS responses drops to 0.9 / second. It stays this way for the next 2 min

*         T=2 min: We've had 2 minutes of <1/s DNS responses.

*         T=2 min + 1 sec: DNS responses return to >1/s.

*         T=4 min + 1 sec: DNS back down to <1/s and stays this way for the next 2 min.

*         T=6 min + 1 sec: We've had 2 min of <1/s DNS

If my alert is edge-triggered, do I:
*         Get an alert at T=2 min and T=~6 min?

Your Edge Triggered Alert in the above scenario will alert at both 2min and at the 4min mark.
I don't understand why I'd get an alert at the 4 min mark. Don't I need 2 minutes of DNS responses under <1/s to switch the alert to True? Shouldn't that occur at T=6?

Second followup (assuming I'm on the right path): If I change the Value over Time to 6 min, then wouldn't I get zero alerts? Because, at no point in the above timeline do I have 6 straight minutes of <1/s DNS.

Hello Rahim,

I have listed a few answers to your questions below.
Let me know if you need any more assistance configuring Alerts to satisfy your needs.

If my alert is edge-triggered, do I:
*         Get an alert at T=2 min and T=~6 min?

Your Edge Triggered Alert in the above scenario will alert at both 2min and at the 4min mark.

When Edge Triggered Alert is set the above scenario will alert on both instances as well since it has like you inferred that goes from False to True and back to False.


If my alert is level-triggered - every 15 minutes - do I still get an alert at T=2 and T=~6? Because the alert expression changed from true to false at T=2?

The Level Triggered Alert will still alerts twice since the expressions timer has been reset by the Value that changes and crosses the Level anyways.

It will just continue alerting every 15 mins until the expression resets itself by in this case the DNS response value has gone above 1 per sec.

If I wanted to get only 1 alert for the above sequence of events ... what's the config?
The best way to only receive alerts once in the 6 min time window you can extend the ""Value over time"" to 6mins.

Regards,
Ian Maple

Hello Eric,

I am able to provide a License file which would allow you to be disconnected for about 1 week if that would help to get you up and running.
To receive a Offline License that will never check in I am contacting your RSM to assist with that request.

Below are the License Files associated with each Product Key.

Hi Scott,

I have done additional research into this, and while I am able to reproduce some sluggishness for a few seconds in the UI after letting a tab with the ExtraHop UI stay open minimized in the background for 20-30 minutes, I do not believe this is an issue specific to ExtraHop, and rather related to how Internet Explorer stores and retrieves background tabs that aren't currently being utilized. It is recommended to engage Microsoft support to further investigate why Internet Explorer is behaving this way. Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns.

Thanks,

Jordan Brengman

So Chris,
Then the question would be how can we identify where the traffic drop is happening...to our understanding these are span ports connected to a TAP device...(not caring of flow or etc)...Do you have any suggestions?

Mirza,

The ExtraHop system is programmed to drop one way traffic. If it cannot see both sides of the conversation, it will drop the traffic.  This is what is making up the 30% drop rate.

Hi support,

Following up on the below request.  It looks like the defective appliance 
still hasn't been shipped back.  Can you follow up with the customer and 
get confirmation on when the 9100 will be sent back?

Thanks,

Karen

Andrew,

It was good working with you.  As discussed over the webex, Jordan from support assisted with restoring the running configuration.  It was confirmed that you will need to manually reset the passwords for local users, but for users authenticating via TACACS, you should be able to authenticate successfully. Let me know if you experience further issues.

Hello Jude,

I verified that the EH8000 is now syncing with Addy. As expected, the detection is 6 days behind due to when the evaluation license expired. You should start to see new anomalies appear while this sync occurs. Current estimates expect it to catch up within the next 6 hours, but the time required may fluctuate as the data in your environment changes.

As I mentioned on the phone, I had this license extended until January 31, 2018 while you work to install the EH9100 and addy license for the EH9100 in your environment. If you need the license extended for the EH8000 (If for some odd reason the EH9100 is not installed by this time) please open a new case so we can track the additional request.

thank you,

Hi Mitchell,

You may have missed it, but according to Kevin this is already in the product, but not documented in the running config guide:

""capture"": {
    ...
    ""app_proto"": {
        ...
        ""http"": {
            ...
            ""user_agent_length_max"": 256
        }
    }

Give that a shot and let us know if it doesn't work and I will reopen this case as a defect.

thanks

Hi Brock,

Hello Sai Krishna Ponna, 

Thank you for sending over the Product key so I could verify the Extrahop Appliance that is associated.
 
We spoke on the phone about migrating product keys over to a new Extrahop 2000v.
You can copy and paste the key into the new device and then power the old 2000v down.

This allows the Product key to check in from the new Virtual Machine to our License Server.

Sounds good, thanks for the quick response.  Are any of the EXA cluster members more important?  Meaning does it matter the specific order that I upgrade each EXA in as long as I do them one at a time as you have described below?  Thanks again!

**STOP! This email did not come from BCBSAZ. Be sure to read through the content and be sure it is safe.**


Jeff,

The standard practice regarding the firmware upgrade process would be to upgrade the firmware in descending order 1st ECA > 2nd EDA >  3rd EXA > 4th EXA.   So if you have a single EDA and three EXAs,  upgrade the firmware on the EDA first, and then upgrade each individual EXA, one at a time.  After you upgrade the first EXA, wait till all indices have returned to a green status.  Once the indices on the EXA are green, move on to the next EXA, and repeat the same process.

Hi Daniel,

This is now scheduled for the next hotfix, so if you can wait for that to be released, then watch for the next release. 

Otherwise, the workaround is to use a shorter email as an alias that forwards to your target email or just use a temporary shorter email name.

It's been a couple weeks since the Jan 5th forum post.  It mentions continuing to evealuate and a patch when upstream ones are available.  Can you tell me what software level to upgrade to for our appliances to be in the clear? Or a date when you expect it to be released?

Hi John,

We now have a forum post on the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities and how they relate to ExtraHop: https://forums.extrahop.com/t/spectre-and-meltdown-attacks/3657. I have also included the contents of this forum post below. Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns.


Spectre and Meltdown attacks

These important vulnerabilities related to low level CPU operations have recently been announced<https://spectreattack.com/>. ExtraHop has investigated and we want to share what we know and our plans to fix these issues.

ExtraHop appliance products are technically vulnerable to all three information leak variants (CVE-2017-5353, 5715 and 5754), however all variants require execution of arbitrary code on the target machine. The only way arbitrary code can be executed on the closed appliance is with triggers and we do not believe the attack is possible through triggers. Still, Administrators should not install untrusted bundles.
ExtraHop will be patching our appliances when final upstream patches are released and tested.

ExtraHop virtual appliances may be vulnerable to information leaks until the supervising hypervisor is patched. System administrators should patch hypervisors when patches are available.

ExtraHop is continually evaluating our product and patching when security issues are made public.

Also see https://extrahop.com/security for information on our security policies.

Daniel,

As we discussed over IM, since this gear is old and out of support,  you'll need to run this like a POC.  Once you obtain and apply the new product keys for the gear, follow the two step upgrade process - 6.x (latest) then upgrade again to 7.1

I'm going to close this ticket.  Call support again and we'll open a new ticket if you encounter issues during the upgrade.

Comment from ravi_chandra_thota@fanniemae.com:
Hello Nick,

We did apply the patch and it crashed our appliance. we had to reboot the appliance.We need to know what went wrong with the patch? We need to make sure that this does not follow in the latest firmware .
Could you please provide us another patch .So we can apply and have a fix for it.

--------------- Resolution Email to Contact ---------------
Ravi,

The support pack Brian applied did not crash the ExtraHop discover. It resulted in capture instability on the EDA due to the changes in place. This targeted support pack that resulted in the instability last week was to address case: 20171030-35147. (SSL applications not committing metrics correctly)

After restarting the EDA to roll back the targeted support pack that cause the capture restart problem, I gathered a support pack and core dump from the affected EDA and reopened 35147. I am going to close this case and we will continue to work on 35147 with engineering to provide an improved fix for the SSL application metric issue.

thank you,

Hi Sam,

As of 6.1, the PATCH method on  /dashboards/{id} can do it as long as the API key used has system level privilege.

the body should be: {""owner"":""new_owner""}
 

curl -i -X PATCH --header ""Content-Type: application/json"" \ --header ""Accept: application/json"" \ --header ""Authorization: ExtraHop apikey={apikey}"" \ -d ""{\""owner\"":\""new_owner\""}"" ""https://{ECA_IP}/api/v1/dashboards/{ID}""

​

If you are on 6.0 or prior, there isn't a way.

Thank you for the information.

Question: The site in question is behind an F5 for load balancing. Can the PFS be installed on the F5 or will we have to install it on each web server in the pool?

Hi Ricardo, 

Thank you for taking the time to have a WebEx. As mentioned, I would go ahead and disable your current triggers related to the Cloud App bundle, download the new bundle version, and apply it. Furthermore, this is not an officially supported bundle, but we can continue to monitor the situation and report any abnormalities. A list of our officially supported bundles can be found here: https://www.extrahop.com/customers/community/bundles/extrahop-created/ 

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

I have also included the contents of this forum post below. Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns.


Spectre and Meltdown attacks

These important vulnerabilities related to low level CPU operations have recently been announced<https://spectreattack.com/>. ExtraHop has investigated and we want to share what we know and our plans to fix these issues.

ExtraHop appliance products are technically vulnerable to all three information leak variants (CVE-2017-5353, 5715 and 5754), however all variants require execution of arbitrary code on the target machine. The only way arbitrary code can be executed on the closed appliance is with triggers and we do not believe the attack is possible through triggers. Still, Administrators should not install untrusted bundles.
ExtraHop will be patching our appliances when final upstream patches are released and tested.

ExtraHop virtual appliances may be vulnerable to information leaks until the supervising hypervisor is patched. System administrators should patch hypervisors when patches are available.

ExtraHop is continually evaluating our product and patching when security issues are made public.

Hi Kurt,

At this point, everything should be setup to reconnect them to addy. Have the customer disconnect and reconnect and the connection should go through. You will want to reach out to sales-ops@extrahop.com to get their license extended to the right date. You can reference this license in salesforce:

Ehsan,

I took a look at the support pack for the EDA. From what the logs suggest the Flow Networks which are not polling are failing authentication. When the SNMP Polling radio button is red, this would indicate that the SNMP credentials have failed remote authentication.  You will want to check your end to confirm why this is the case.

Hi Omar,

According to the engineering team, the request will get set to 0 if the flow closes or expires before the response is set.  This can be anywhere from 30s to 600s.  It all depends on how long the flow lasts before it's closed without a response.

Hope that helps.

Thanks,
Travis Walentin

Good afternoon support, very strange message: ''Our team has told me this issue should have been addressed and they say on their end your appliance shows it is receiving data.'' What does it all mean? I do not have any data when I click on alerts or anomalies as you may noticed:

May I inquire how this stands as have been addressed? Sorry but I'm not very satisfied with the outcome, surely there is something missing or not configured properly and they comeback with the weird message!!!!! I would appreciate something more substantial as an explanation. What do you thing Mr Gabrail? Thank you! Regards!

Hi Henry,

If the connection is closed for any reason (session gets torn down unexpectedly) it'll come in as an abort. 

It might not be an explicit request to abort by the client.

This week is our big sales meeting for the year, so Kanen should be able to give you more insight as he'll know more about your environment when he gets back.

Hi Support Team,

 

Thank you for your response.

They were able to download the firmware using the account you changed
privileges.

 

Please let us know the reason why NTT could not download firmware this time.

We have to explain it to them.

 

I guess that they logged in using an account that is not allowed to
download, but is it correct?

 

If so, please tell me how to create a user with permission to download.

I just realized that you don't have the appliance that would keep packets (Extrahop Trace Appliance or ETA).  Therefore the you shouldn't see anything when you click the bullseye.

Hello Bill and Barry,

I am going to close this case. We were successfully able to replace the firmware, but had to manually modify the running configuration to get the bonded interface restored. I opened a request with engineering to allow configuration of a Bonded interface via the CLI in the future. We still have two additional cases open to resolve usability problems that occurred due to the swap and I will continue to update you on the other cases as we address issues that presented themself due to this change.

thank you,

Nick Sturza,RE: RPCAP configuration,2/1/18,LIC-028951,1/22/18 2:56,0,1,GTA,20180122-36796,,"--------------- Internal Comment ---------------
Closing this case since it is duplicate. Issue is being worked under 20180117-36718 GTA RPCAP Configuration

--------------- Resolution Email to Contact ---------------
Hello support,

Today we tried to configure RPCAPd on GTA's 9100 as per this thread and the
standard documentation from our portal.  We ran into the following problems:

1) It does not seem possible to configure a second 1Gbps interface as RPCAP
only (even via running config).  This was speculative as it is not
documented but seems reasonable.
2) If a second 1Gbps interface is configured for manage-rpcap-erspan and
has a numerically higher IP address, it becomes the single active
management interface.  this breaks the connection from the ECA to EDA which
should not be expected behaviour and I could not find documented.
3) If an interface is changed in the ""running config"", it is not actually
implemented immediately as would be expected.  The ""running config"" has to
be committed as the ""saved config"" before changes to interfaces take
effect.  This is a terminology issue and would not be obvious to someone
familiar with running config changes taking immediate effect.

The possible design we would like to follow is:

===============
*1Gbps*
Interface 1: Mgmt only
Interface 2: Disabled (possible future NetFlow)
Interface 3: RPCAP for IDC 1
Interface 4: RPCAP for IDC 2

*10 Gbps*
Interface 5: Promiscuous Capture
Interface 6: Promiscuous Capture
Interface 7: Promiscuous Capture
Interface 8: Promiscuous Capture
===============

Please could you comment on whether this is possible or not and engage with
Glue/Dev as appropriate?

Many thanks,
Jon

Hello Kurt,

This maybe related to the case you opened last week with the license going active / inactive when they were extended:

https://extrahop.my.salesforce.com/5008000001703u8

Support doesn't have access to the hopcloud servers or data and cannot help with data validity or data review for Addy metric questions. I would like to help troubleshoot but I have no additional visibility than what you have via the UI. We do have access to the moving parts for UI related issues for the Addy screen, licensing issues, connectivity issues, protocol parsing issues, etc.  I recommend posting to the internal forum to get guidance from PM on how to review the Anomaly data with your customers. Maybe request PM to have an internal room created for Addy discussions? for now, I recommend:

Hi Paco,

Sorry for the delay. I finally had time to do a packet capture. I pulled all netflow traffic for 5 min off this system and looked for examples where there is more than 1 flow interface. 
Here you can see two Flows in packet 367
Flow 1
[Inline image name : Screen Shot 2018-02-08 at 3.16.40 PM.png]
Flow 2
[Inline image name : Screen Shot 2018-02-08 at 3.12.20 PM.png]
We see both Flows in EXA:
Flow 1
[Inline image name : Screen Shot 2018-02-08 at 3.16.45 PM.png]
Flow 2
[Inline image name : Screen Shot 2018-02-08 at 3.12.15 PM.png]

I am not sure whats going on with your trigger, but from what I can tell we are correctly parsing netflow data for second flow ASN information.

Hello Lucas,

The short answer is that you will need to upgrade your EXA nodes at near the same time and do not need to wait for them to go green to continue. You don't want to restart them all at once, but a rolling restart (waiting until the web UI is back online for the first system before continuing to the next one) is acceptable. It is also recommended to stop sending new data to the EXA cluster while the upgrade is being preformed.

The firmware release notes for the EXA goes into additional detail. You can read the complete guidance here:
https://docs.extrahop.com/7.1/customers/exa-release-notes/

Please let us know if you have any additional questions.

I think we're good.

We have this running and working, then added a routing rule for the OUTGOING send of the data back to ExtraHop EDA. We've added a 3rd interface to this VM so we can directly route this rpcap data over to ExtraHop without saturating the  admin network.

Sonal,

Your understanding is correct, the interface(s) specified in the rpcapd.ini are those which will have their traffic forwarded on to the ExtraHop, rather than the interface over which the RPCAP traffic is forwarded to the ExtraHop.

Joe,

The RPCAP installation guide contains instructions on configuring the rpcapd.ini file with multiple interfaces, including example configurations: https://docs.extrahop.com/current/rpcap/#configure-rpcapd-on-a-linux-device-with-multiple-interfaces-. Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this process. If you would like to schedule a screen share to configure this please let me know your availability this week and I will send a WebEx invite.

Hello Jose,

Thank you for joining the call. As we found, the EXA had recovered by the time we could schedule this meeting. The EXA prioritizes resources to try and ingest data first, respond to queries second, and provide management overhead third. Due to the continued ingest throughout the upgrade, it took a while to finish the migration and respond to queries.
 

I changed the replication level to '0' so that your single node deployment would not keep attempting shard reallocation. I also recommend for future upgrades to disable data ingest during the upgrade. We highlight this suggestion in the release notes:

Upgrade guidance
Contact ExtraHop Support if you need assistance with your upgrade.

Upgrades require a 7.1 license.

You must upgrade all Explore nodes in an Explore cluster. Note that during upgrade, any nodes on different firmware versions are unable to communicate with each other.
Upgrade your Discover and Command appliances to version 7.1 before you upgrade your Explore appliances.
After you upgrade your Discover and Command appliances, some types of record queries will not return correct results until the Explore appliance is also upgraded to version 7.1.
We highly recommend that you disable all triggers on the Discover appliances that commit records to the Explore cluster and disable automatic flow records before upgrading. You can re-enable these settings after the Explore cluster status returns to Green. Note that records will not be collected during the upgrade.

https://docs.extrahop.com/7.1/customers/exa-release-notes/

The easiest way to stop data ingest during the upgrade is to navigate to the EDA admin page > Connect Explore Appliances 
and press the red 'x' to disconnect the EDA from the EXA. The data on the EXA will be preserved and you can reconnect once all the shards are green after the upgrade. 

Please let us know if you have any additional questions or concerns.

thank you,
Nick Sturza

Hi Jimy,

You could add this to the running config 
 

""webserver"": {
    ""ssl_profile"": ""old""
}
​

​

This would allow older, non secure suites to be accepted.  However you would have to make sure that the client is using something that can be decrypted.  I'm not sure how you would force that.  I think if the browser is using a newer suite, it will still connect with that newer suite.

Intentionally weakening your encryption isn't something we recommend for obvious reasons.

Thanks,
Travis Walentin

*** Be aware - This email came from an external source. Do not open attachments or click links if you do not recognize the sender. ***
Hi Eric,

Referencing the Trigger Best Practices document I sent in a previous email, the best course of action is to implement a try/catch statement to handle the exceptions. Below is a basic example for reference. Furthermore, you can also utilize an if/else statement, checking each variable definition for null/undefined values before proceeding to the following variable definitions, though this method would be cumbersome. Moreover, I will recommend to our internal team that exceptions be handled in this function in both bundles in the bundle gallery.

Example of try/catch:

try {
    var info = uri.split("">"")[0];
    // add the corresponding variable definitions name, rest, etc.
}
catch(err) {
    // handle the error here
    // you can also exit the function, return a value, return null, etc.
    console.log(""there is an error"");
}

Example using if/else and checking to see if the argument or variable is null or undefined:

function cleanURI(uri){

    while(true) {

        // the ! checks if either ""null"" or ""undefined""
        if (!uri){
            return; // exit the function if null or undefined
        }
        else {
            var info = uri.split("">"")[0];
        }

// repeat nested if/else for corresponding variable definitions

Had a call with Jose and he was not happy with the result of the data review. Jose expectation was that I could find the root cause of a client that had disconnected for what appeared to be a timespan of 3 mins. I explaining the flow of the client to the router and showing retransmission, drops and out of sequence timestamps  to IP's behind 2 routers. Next, questions arose about traffic behind 2 routers Cisco AD32c1 and HSRP Router 14. In the review I showed Jose and 2 other members of the team how to follow the flow based on protocols. however, Because I was given very little information about the topography of the network, and the architecture of the Device (172.19.2.35), Jose hung up in frustration that I could not give a clear explanation of the root cause of the 3 mins of connectivity issue for his client. I requested IP or host name of any back end server that worked with the Client in question and explained with out that information it was only possible to explain how the ExtraHop works and could be used. I was told many time by Jose he didn't not understand what we where looking it in regards to his client or way his client was talking to two endpoints that his team was calling routers (Cisco AD32c1 and HSRP Router 14).

I recommend sharing this information in training next week to learn more about how to analysis an environment using ExtraHop. I also asked if they would like me to share these details with their account team to use as a example in training next week. Jose was not interested in this option.

Subject: RE: devices in a subnet are not discovered [ ref:_00D80LnBG._5008017mg2b:ref ]

Tomasz,

A Custom device will provide a aggregated view of all devices on the subnet.  If you would like all devices in the subnet to be discovered individually, you can setup what is call a Remote Network.  Same thing, but all devices will show up individually.


https://docs.extrahop.com/current/eh-admin-ui-guide/#remote-discovery

Remote Discovery

  1.  Log into the Admin UI on the Discover appliance.
  2.  In the System Configuration section, click Capture.
  3.  Click Discover by IP.
  4.  The Enabled checkbox is selected by default. If the checkbox is deselected, select Enabled.
  5.  In the Remote Networks section, click Change.
  6.  In the Remote Discovery section, type the IP address in the IP address range field. You can specify one IP address or a CIDR notation, such as 192.168.0.0/24 for an IPv4 network or 2001:db8::/32 for an IPv6 network.

Hello Demetrius,

Is your goal to completely repurpose your EDA with a new datafeed? If so, I recommend a factory reset before reuse. You can find the instructions here:

https://docs.extrahop.com/current/eh-rescue-media/#reset-the-extrahop-system-to-factory-defaults

This will reset the EDA to the factory defaults and allow you to rebuild it from scratch. Please note, you need to disconnect the EDA from any ECA, EXA or ETA before doing this procedure.

If this is not your goal, I would be happy to review what you are trying to accomplish. Please let me know additional detail or feel free to call the main support line at (877) 333-9872 ext. 2 and a member of the support team can assist you further.

Hey Heather,

I wanted to give you a little more detail on what the issue was here.  We host Addy in a secure AWS instance and use multiple layers of encryption for the connection.  Part of the encryption uses Server Name Indication (SNI) and without going into too much detail, the way that that was configured, caused the connection to look suspicious by some security tools that were tearing down the connection.

Hello John,
If this is still not booting, I think we have a work-around for your EDA1100 failing to boot. Can you try the following work around:
1) Plug in a usb keyboard
2) restart (you can either unplug and plug it back in or hold down the power button)
3) press the 'shift' key on the keyboard for 1-2 minutes. you don't want to hold it down, but press it randomly.

We believe we are running into an entropy problem on the EDA1100 and this may help with the randomization needed on first boot.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Hello Charles,

Thank you for contacting ExtraHop support. We reviewed the overall outage window and focused on the HTTP Servers and the other underlying protocols that these HTTP servers use for communication. From what we can tell, there was a reduction of HTTP transactions and throughput during the outage window of 11 AM EST. We were unable to find other affected protocols or signs that there was anything other than an increase in processing time and reduction of transactions and throughput.

At this point, it appears the problem was either local to these web servers or affecting parts of your network that are not directly part of the ExtraHop datafeed. If you have any additional questions or concerns, feel free to reach out and we can review further.

thank you,

Hi Mario, 

Right now, the best solution is to make your own Self-Signed Certs and put them on the boxes if you don't want to use SHA-1. We don't have a way to specify what is used to have our units generate the cert.  I've put in a feature request to get it moved to the newer SHA-2 format.

Thanks,

Subject: RE: [**External**] Need new CSR [ ref:_00D80LnBG._5008017oJ73:ref ]

Hi Tami,

I apologize for the confusion, given an existing certificate and private key, you can use the below openssl command to generate a CSR:



openssl x509 -x509toreq -in certificate.crt -out CSR.csr -signkey privateKey.key

This should output the CSR as the filename you put in place of ""CSR.csr"" when running the command. You may also find the following link helpful as it contains many common openssl operations: https://www.sslshopper.com/article-most-common-openssl-commands.html<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sslshopper.com%2Farticle-most-common-openssl-commands.html&data=02%7C01%7Cdufourt%40sutterhealth.org%7C7a336ac8e1464b3fc56a08d57018dbcc%7C4529a81c4fb64d48bcb0b9604c1cb0ae%7C0%7C0%7C636538174426620602&sdata=LpdskwISSzG4EaX5vYtpqBSTrdaflhoqTECaxbVAr2M%3D&reserved=0>.

Nick and I got on with Curo this morning and resolved this issue. The customer had deleted the trigger after running the support pack (info supplied by Ian) so the images and the support pack were out of sync. The real issue was that the system sync did not remove the trigger from the EDA.

Resolution was to do a backup on the system, disconnect the EDA's, restore the system. Unfortunately, the restore did not restore the connections so they had to be manually re-added and all dashboards have to have the data sources reset manually. (Nick is created another ticket for that)

--------------- Resolution Email to Contact ---------------
Hey Mitch,

I was hovering over Nick as he worked with you on this case.  It appears we have this one resolved and Nick has already opened another case for the backup and restore issue you encountered.  

We still have the stability problem with the one EDA.  Let's watch and see what impact of the elimination of those trigger exceptions will have on that system while we investigate the support pack.

I'll close this one out and we'll continue to track the other one on the other thread.

Hi Eugene, 

I would check with the local Admin of the Extrahop to see why your credentials wouldn't be working.

We don't have access to the local boxes or settings, but we can help the admins of them troubleshoot things if they aren't able to get you logged in.

Hi Jaime,

Thank you for contacting ExtraHop Support. If you go to Settings->Alerts-> then select the Anomaly alert type (you will have a custom Addy alert name on this list but the type is ""Anomaly""), then you can click into the alert and under Notifications you will be able to add additional email addresses that will receive the notification. I included a screenshot below of the Notifications window.

Please let me know if you have any additional questions.

Here are some troubleshooting steps you could try:

Here is an easy way to get the right Guid. this script will output all Friendly named devices that start with Local (NetConnectionID) Description of interface, GUID and MAC Address. You can modify the -like to contain another name or change it to MACAddress to search by MAC (note Powershell requires * for -like wildcard searches... ) run in powershell:

get-WMIObject WIn32_NetworkAdapter | Where-Object {$_.NetConnectionID -like 'Local*'} | Format-List NetConnectionID,Description,GUID,MACAddress

In the example above, this can be put into the c:\Program files\rpcapd\rpcapd.ini as follows:

ActiveClient = 192.168.50.90, 2003,ifname=\Device\NPF_{BF4AE208-0195-4A47-BC8E-9F27A8E86AA0} NullAuthPermit = YES

Once this is complete, i believe a simple restart of the rpcapd service should start the connection. There are also other examples in the AWS for 3.10 Appendix C documentation here:

https://forum.extrahop.com/static/Monitoring_Amazon_Web_Services_310.pdf#page=24

Please let me know if this helps or if you have additional questions.

I'm confused why you say that we are not within our limits on this
appliance because the screenshots from the Device Limits and Eligible for
Licensing shows we are within limits.  I was looking at the screenshot you
sent and the device count by process but isn't that every IP address the
device might see communicating with our eligible devices? I think this
ticket should be reopened.

Hi Chris,

The Netflow interface information is pooled as part of the netflow template using the vendor MIB and it should list out the exact speed of the interface being monitored by netflow. 

This article is for cisco netflow; but goes into more detail about how to configure the local settings:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/netflow/configuration/15-mt/nf-15-mt-book/cfg-snmp-mib-mon-nf.pdf

If the interface is being switched to different speeds (in auto and changing?) or because you are hard coding the changes and the extrahop is not updating can you please let me know? I did find a defect that we should have fixed in 6.2.X but not sure if this is just a generic question or observation of an issue.

thanks

Hello Mike,

As we reviewed. It looks like one of your ExtraHop system is getting incomplete data from the cisco device you want to monitor. This looks like limited, uni-directional data and i suggest investigating the span or tap that you are using to send data to the extrahop system. I CCed Malcolm so he is aware of what we reviewed.

Here is the L7 data for the gateway that is working:

Hey Khaled,

I'm looking this having a dynamic query in extrahop.
What I'm targeting is that, when a device is added, and it saw a specific detail/s like, "" Region = Europe"",  Device = MPLS Router  it will appear in the mpls dashboard. See below.

Let me know if this should be opened in another ticket or it can ride this request as well.

Anthony,

You can find the serial number on a pull out tab directly below the LCD on physical appliances.  You can also view the serial number by viewing the license file (Settings > Administration > license).

Hi Khaled,

Dashboard which we created doesn't give the exact bw value. Refer the below. It shows traffic for particular service was just 1100 KB/s.

If you run a report from any location WAN router, it shows different value. Refer the below.

Good morning,
Is this ticket still open or do I need to create a new one?
This issue is still ongoing.  Most of our dashboards display ""Unknown Error"" when we try to access them.    If I create a new dashboard from scratch it seems to work.
I've tried logging in as administrator and overwriting the dashboards but so far that has not worked.
Thanks!

Subject: RE: EDA is in accessible. [ ref:_00D80LnBG._5008018ZF4R:ref ]

Hi Tom,

Thank you for this information. It seems the issue might be related to changing your remote auth settings. When these settings are changed, such as switching from TACACS to LDAP, it essentially deletes all users thus deleting their dashboards.

https://docs.extrahop.com/current/eh-admin-ui-guide/#configure-ldap-authentication

""If you change LDAP authentication at a later time to a different remote authentication method, users, user groups, and associated customizations that were created through remote authentication are removed. Local users are unaffected.""

You can rely on that workaround in the future, but this may be related to changing your authentication method.

Best,

Hi John,

As long as your disk is fast enough, you should have no issues adding your extended datastore as planned. However, your appliance is overloaded in terms of device counts, which is why you system is experiencing UI slowness. This is being addressed in case # ending in 37779. Furthermore, you do not need to do any special formatting for your CIFS.

Please let me know if you have any questions. We do have a member on call on the weekends who can get back to you if you run into any issues on Saturday.

Hi Rahul,

These can be expected depending on how the traffic is getting to the appliance.

It looks like you are seeing less than 1% of your traffic as Desyncs which isn't much.  Sure in a vacuum it would be 0, but even our lab devices here at the office have a small percentage of desyncs.

It's the same thing with the drops.  If you are under 1%, it's likely fine.  If you are consistently seeing 2%+ drops, then it could be cause for concern.

Hope that helps.

Only way to nc from the box is to do it from SSH access. I generated the ssh support key and sent it to her.  We did the nc command on a screen share.  She got the screenshot she needed then I verified the sessions were closed and the support account was disabled.

This is the 2nd time she's needed to do this in the last few months.

Perhaps there is a custom support pack we can build that runs the commands she needs then she can download the logs?  This will removed the need to expose the SSH key to the user.

I told her that if she needs to do this again, to open a support case and let us know what commands she would like to have run.  From that we can have GLUE build a targeted support pack to get her the info she needs.

Hi Brendan, 

I am checking back to see how the Trigger code adjustments to eliminate the Exceptions went?
we saw: 
app.metricAddDistinct(""cg_radius_heartbeat"",map['frame_ip']);
app.metricAddDistinct(""cg_dns_heartbeat"",dns_client_ip);
app.metricAddDistinct(""cg_cwmp_heartbeat"",client_ip);

Where each of these app.MetricAddDistinct() needed the ""app"" called out.
eg: var app = Radius

Hello Sebastian,
Thank you for calling Extrahop Support and joining the WebEx!

I am going to close this case since there is already an open case for the same issue, 20180304-37818.

Kafka open data stream is showing ""Message Send Errors"". You have another working Open Data Stream for Kafka which is working and displaying no errors.

We are going to investigate this further and send you an update.

Hello,

thank you for the update, we have 2 more questions :


1.       is this appliance running a real shell like a real Linux server where some standard Linux software packages could be installed like backup utilities ?


2.       except the basic configuration are on this appliance stored some users data which need a backup on regular basis ?


thanks,

Alexander,

From our records the single virtual EXA instance is currently running firmware 7.0.1.  I would expect that you can use any rescue media which is equal or higher value than the current firmware running on the system.

Hello Steve,

Thank you for joining the WebEx session to review the Citrix information in your environment. Today we had a chance to:

1) Review the Citrix bundle installed in your environment Highlight two user sessions that were slow yesterday to better understand how a user experience issue would manifest itself in the ExtraHop UI. These sessions correlated with elevated TCP connection resets and were probably related a network issue reported at the time. 

2) We reviewed the newly added option for 'Combined Sources' on dashboards. You can use this option to get a better visualization across the citrix bundle without having a dashboard for each EDA.

3) We Reviewed ExtraHop Alerts: https://docs.extrahop.com/current/alerts/ To highlight changes in the environment and better focus outage notification without having to rely on users reporting problems.

4) we noticed that for at least one citrix terminal server or end point, we are seeing application metrics for HTTP and storage, but not for ICA Client information. It appears that the session information may not be part of the feed; or EUEM (end user monitoring) may not be keeping track of this specific session. We did highlight the current visibility on all other client sessions.

I have CCed your ExtraHop account reps so they are aware of what we reviewed and can answer additional technical questions about a targeted alerting or investigating the missing Citrix visibility. It maybe that this data is just not being sent to the extrahop EDAs at this time.

We reviewed quite a bit of information. If you have any follow-up questions, please let me know. Or feel free to reach out to us at (877) 333-9872 ext. 2 or support@extrahop.com for additional assistance.

Since there is an jira ticket opened from a PM (EX-25612 if you want to follow), it'll get fixed with the same or more priority as creating a customer escalation.  T-mobile's name is attached to that ticket and it's in critical priority.  This support ticket in salesforce will just sit in known issue status until that EX is resolved.  So, I'm just going to close this case with the EX ticket attached. If you want updates to give to the T-Mobile team, just keep tabs on the EX ticket.

If T-mobile calls in, they can reference this case number (20180309-37940).  The support team can look this up and it'll point them to the EX ticket to get the current status of it.

Hope that makes sense.

Thank you for the Support Pack after letting the EDA run without the Trigger enabled for a few days.

The detached packets spikes that ranged from 40-50 Per Second decreased to almost 0.
And the Capture cycles show the Trigger removal where the load dropped by about %90.

Between those two stats the EDA should be much more stable and responsive.
I think we can close this case out unless there is something else needing attention the the Extrahop Appliance?

Hi Stephen,

In regards to guidance on QRadar integration, we have documentation on ODS configuration since this is sending data off box: https://docs.extrahop.com/7.0/eh-admin-ui-guide/#open-data-streams

Furthermore, there exists documentation on verifying QRadar receives syslog events: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS42VS_7.3.0/com.ibm.qradar.doc/t_QRadar_Troubleshooting_guide_verifyEvents.html

I've also CCed your Channel Sales Manager and Sales Engineer who can assist you with any additional questions.

Hi Anthony,

You can check out our Thread ID bundle: https://www.extrahop.com/customers/community/bundles/extrahop/threat-id/

You can view all the bundles here: https://www.extrahop.com/customers/community/bundles/

It might not have exactly what you are after, but you could take some of what that does as an example and make your own triggers and dashboards to monitor exactly what you're after.

This blog post is a little old, so the exact how to might not be accurate, but the design workflow should still help guide you.

https://www.extrahop.com/company/blog/2015/the-step-by-step-guide-to-building-stellar-extrahop-dashboards/

Khurram, 

I discussed this issue with engineers regarding the 6100v and seeing the Sales Engineering thread it looks like you can connect 3 10G feeds but once the aggregate traffic exceeds 10G the VM will start to drop packets.

Dis that thread answer your questions?

Hi Drew,

After our phone call I saw there was a JIRA ticket cited for this issue in December. As such, this case won't be escalated as there is a JIRA ticket already created for this issue: https://jira.i.extrahop.com/browse/EX-24253

This JIRA ticket is the open issue that is directly related to the problem you experienced. When this backup and restore procedure is initiated, it actually completes. But our UI does not indicate a restart is necessary nor does it force a redirect. In terms of the suggestion of having SSH access to see the status, that would also be a feature request you would need to post in our internal forum.

I did see you commented on the feature request I posted on your behalf. This method is an effective way for PM to gain visibility into the issue, as I see members from PM have already commented on this post: https://forums.extrahop.com/t/backup-restore-prompt-for-restart/3909/5

As per our policy, since this is not a bug with the product as the backup and restoration process was functional, and since this issue is currently open as an EX ticket, we will be closing this case.

Best,

Preston Ramirez

Hi Anna, 

The process we recommend is:
Upgrade ECAs then EDAs and once they are finished you can then upgrade the EXA/ETA.
I agree that if you disconnect all the ECA/EDAs sending records to the EXA cluster you can expedite this process.

There is not any reason to keep the ECA connected to the EXA cluster during its upgrade.

Hi Preston,

I think you need to review your statement : ""When the exclusion interval ends, ExtraHop has no knowledge of the previous alert state.  As a result, alerts fire on the next event after the exclusion interval to re-report the current state.  This is also one of the reasons for the alert delays, after reviewing your log files, the alert emails are sent at the time the alert was triggered after the exclusion.  ""

For instance today the ""resolved"" alert came at 6h10 in my mailbox:



While the condition of the alert has been lower than 30 since the moment the exclusion interval ended at 5h:



Your recommendation is not possible, the system receiving the alerts need to receive the correct information.

Subject: RE: ExtraHop Networks Case #20180316-38097 is Waiting For Your Input - [] [ ref:_00D80LnBG._5008018dFJk:ref ]

Hi Peter,

We are following up with a status on this case.

Issues

To recap, you are citing two issues:

1) The ""resolved"" alert fires after exiting the exclusion interval, but no corresponding ""original"" alert ever fired.

2) There is a delay on when the threshold ""resolved"" alerts are fired. Your expectation is that these alerts should be sent at 5:00, the moment the exclusion interval ends.

Review

In response to the first issue regarding threshold alerts, ExtraHop is not designed to report ""all clear"" after an alert.  Each alert is treated as if it is evaluating failure, the green state is really just meant for the UI, not as a flag to send to a third party product.

ExtraHop does not record the alert state upon entering the exclusion interval. When the exclusion interval ends, ExtraHop has no knowledge of the previous alert state.  As a result, alerts fire on the next event after the exclusion interval to re-report the current state.  This is also one of the reasons for the alert delays, after reviewing your log files, the alert emails are sent at the time the alert was triggered after the exclusion.

Recommendation

Since threshold alerts have no recollection of state upon exiting the exclusion interval, the recommended path is to remove exclusion intervals from the EDA and move them to the system receiving the alerts. This will prevent the issue of receiving ""resolved"" alerts, but no ""original"" alerts.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best,

Preston Ramirez

Octavio,

It was good speaking with you over the phone. As discussed, over the webex, you were able to run a global packet capture, and we were able to verify that there are out of order packets and retransmissions present for the node in question.  You will work with your network team to troubleshoot the network feed further.

Depending if that worked on the one I sent you.

The error message stated two issues.
One being the EXA license was the issue.
Two was the clsuter status was not Green.


Were you able to upgrade to 1 EXA?
Did you stop all Triggers firing or disconnect ECAs and EDAs that would be firing triggers?

  *   You must disable all triggers on the Discover appliances that commit records to the Explore cluster and disable automatic flow records before upgrading. You can re-enable these settings after the Explore cluster status returns to Green. Note that records will not be collected during the upgrade.

Hi Preston

Customers use the monitor all the time, and after 3 months of using 2TB data, it can not be down time. You can find an alternative to lower customer data risk.

Please find other options and explain the reasons to support.

Thank You.
Apichat.

Hi John,

No, there isn't anything wrong with your licenses.

You are seeing this because we have new versions of the firmware available.  The license you have is usually only licensed for a specific range of versions.  When we release new versions, we add these new versions to your license to allow you to upgrade.  When your appliance goes to check in, it will see the new version of the license and notify you that there is a new one to be applied. 

You won't be able to upgrade unless this new license is applied.

We've had a few releases in the last few months, so that's why you have seen it recently.

Hope this makes sense.

Travis Walentin

Hi Sonal,

If the setup:serial number isn't working for logging in (assuming entered correctly), then they changed it.  You could reset it back to default from the rescue media.

There's nothing that changed in the latest versions for this functionality.

Hi Chris, 

Sorry for the delay on this case. It was stuck in our support tracking system. We just introduced a new version of the ExtraHop appliances, 7.2.
You can read the release notes here:
https://customer.extrahop.com/downloads/release-notes/

When we rollout new platforms, we have to update the licenses with the additional versions and any enhanced modules that now need license line items. In 7.2 we added module support for RDP and SCCP (Skinny) VOIP traffic. Due to timing, the licenses were updated more than once. You also may get notifications about licenses from time to time as additional functionality is changed. 

The license update notifications should have ceased and I wouldn't expect anymore for the short term. You can also be more precise with 'who' receives these notifications by modifying the https://<extrahop>/admin > Notifications > Email Groups > System Health Notifications setting:
[Inline image name : Screen Shot 2018-03-28 at 8.00.50 AM.png]

You can unselect this checkbox to avoid receiving notifications.

If you have follow-up product questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact us in support at support@extrahop.com or (877) 333-9872 ext 2.

thank you,

Hi Anna,

I found a ticket for this issue in our system, so it's a known issue on 7.1.1 and 7.1.2.   It's fixed in 7.1.3.  So if it's not too difficult, you could make the change to 7.1.3 on the rest of the boxes instead of 7.1.2.

I know that's not the easiest thing in the world for you guys, but I hope you can go to the latest hotfix of 7.1 without a big change order ordeal.

Hi Hongso, 

To migrate existing metric data to new EDA you can leverage the External Datastore process.
Step 7 and 8 is the section to pay attention to:
     Select the checkbox to store 5-minute and 1-hour metrics on the extended datastore. 24-hour metrics are always stored on the extended datastore.
     Specify whether to migrate existing metrics to the extended datastore by selecting from one of the following options.

To migrate existing metrics, click Move existing metrics to the extended datastore.
To retain existing metrics on the local datastore, click Keep existing metrics on the ExtraHop.
Here is a ink to the documentation.
https://docs.extrahop.com/current/configure_exds/ <https://docs.extrahop.com/current/configure_exds/>

Calculate size of Extended Datastore to create

Hi Ian,
I apologize, I don't know if you're working today or not.  If I don't hear from you, then I'll open a new case later today.

Anyways, we're planning to upgrade the EXAs tonight, and I wanted to confirm the proper steps to disconnect, and then reconnect the EXAs.  Previously you mentioned using https://EXAURL/admin/cluster/clients/.  I see where to remove them, but how best to reconnect them?  Is it just from the ECA, https://docs.extrahop.com/current/connect-eda-eca-exa/?  Should we also stop the EXA Connector trigger?

Thanks again.

Thanks for taking the call and hanging on while I confirmed with an Engineer that you can send records when being on various Firmware versions.
Let us know how the Indexing goes and the next planned upgrade window.

That license worked and the 7.2 upgrade is in progress. I'll loop back tomorrow to install the SSL card. Do you have any install docs - I want to make sure its in the correct slot (unless its obvious)

Thx!

Ok,

So it looks like you wanted to use SSL decryption, but didn't have a card.  So we sent you the card and enabled the license for it at the end of 2017.

You haven't had a chance to put the card in, so the current license thinks you have it but can't see it so it freaks out.

That would make sense.

Here's the license without SSL Decryption.  When you install the card, you can open a new case (referencing this one wouldn't hurt) to get the SSL decryption turned back on.

Hi Mitch,

It looks like we have a case open for each one of the issues you stated in my other case for Curo of this same name. you mentioned:

  1.  Service restarts'
  2.  Data seems very inconsistent from this EDA similar to bursting but with out the burst being seen in Gigamon
  3.  Alerts with no data.
Number 1 and 2 are being covered by Chris Macci and have been escalated to the development team. My issue is we now have 2 tickets open for number 3. I will close this case and follow the following action plan under the duplicate case.

Action Plan
Get a support pack to confirm what we should get in SMTP.

Warm reagards,

Russell Powers

Hi Richard,

Your Explorer appliance is a virtual one. 

Those are:

UN: setup
PW: default

by default.

Try that.  If that doesn't work you will have to reset it or find what it was changed to.
